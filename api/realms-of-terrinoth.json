            "The feral beasts that terrorize the people of Terrinoth are only pale echoes of the dragons to be found in the Molten Heath. Here, the oldest, wisest, and most powerful dragons make their kingdom, under the guidance of the Dragon Rex. Ancient dragons have all the physical power of their southern kin, matched to an intellect and mastery of magic beyond any mortal. Seldom have the dragons seen fit to meddle in the affairs of mortals, and since the time of the Dragon Wars, these godlike beings have largely passed into legend.",
            "The vast minds of dragons are alien to those of Humans and their kin, and even the Elves can only barely grasp the desires and plots of these ancient wyrms. Scholars still puzzle over the reasons for the Dragon Wars and for the dragons' abrupt departure. In the vanishingly rare event that a dragon's activities are known to mortals, they are likely to seem cruel or even senseless. Dragons measure time in spans that mortals can scarcely comprehend; without this context, the lesser races cannot hope to grasp the true cause or goal of a dragon's action. Compounding matters, dragons have little regard for the lives of Humans or the other peoples of Mennara, with the notable exception of the Elves.",
            "Dragons do sometimes make use of Humans, Orcs, and the other peoples of Mennara in their continued guardianship. More often than not, such individuals never realize they serve the interests of a dragon—particularly in the case of Dwarves, who harbor an abiding hatred for the Dragonkin. Despite the risks of relying on such inferior creatures, throughout history, a number of dragons have seen the mortals of Mennara as potentially useful tools in the battle to protect the Yrthwrights' creation from the depredations of the Ynfernael and the abyssal entities that dwell within."

These cults of murder serve the Caliph and their viziers and train their assassins in hidden mountain temples and oasis fortresses. At the Tower of Knives, which hangs like a dagger from the cavern roof of Haruun, acrobatic killers master the arts of wall walking. In the Valley of Ash, Brotherhood members train with mysterious bladewomen to learn the secrets of silent killing and night fighting.",
            "Once an assassin has accepted a contract to kill, they are unwavering in pursuit of their prey, taking an oath to the masters of their order that the sands will drink either the blood of their victim or their own. The true talent of an assassin, however, lies in their ability to blend in with their surroundings. They are also well trained in disguise, and no matter their own gender or form can take on new personas to move among any echelon of Al-Kalim's society."

            "Some say the Elves use arcane, ritualistic magic to animate huge Deepwood trees. Others claim that the trees achieved mobility on their own, a byproduct from millennia of magic being cast across the Aymhelin. No matter their origin, the trees of the Aymhelin are potent allies. Scions are young, only a few centuries old perhaps, and often accompany the Elves when battle must be done outside the great forest. Though not as powerful as Forest Guardians, these trees can ensnare foes to make then easy targets for Elven archers."

The origins of these bestial creatures is the subject of dark myths, and most firmly hold that they have existed in Mennara long before Waiqar was born. All tales agree, though, that their vicious, undead form has no resemblance to any living creature, and that they appear more the work of some twisted mentality than any natural evolution.",
            "Barghests often travel in scouting packs, attacking from out of woodlands and misted fields to harass and drive prey. They prefer to strike when the night is darkest, relying on their keen senses of smell and taste to detect the signs of life. Those that prove their worth are elevated to become barghest alphas; these share a special mystical bond with their undead master. By meditating, the necromancer can extend their grasp over the barghest alpha, seeing through its eyes and directing the others in its pack with even greater control."

Many seek further glory in a knightly order, such as the Knights of the Greatwood, or the legendary Citadel Guard. Tougher than the average swordsman, baronial knights are usually armed with either a long spear or a sword and a shield to ward off blows.",

From their sworn baron, these warriors receive a small stipend as well as their weapons, distinctive plate armor, and extensive martial training. As a result of that training, average baronial knights are stalwart and experienced enough to hold their own against far more powerful foes, at least until reinforcements can arrive."

Forsaking the discipline of drill and formation, as well as armor and shield, scorning anything that might slow their headlong charge into the fray, they become depraved murderers in combat.",

These fearsome spurs can be deadly in the embrace of melee, where opponents are shredded simply by getting too close to a berserker's thrashing form. For their actual weaponry, berserkers tend to favor the largest and most vicious items they can find, such as crude hook axes, sawtooth blades, or spiked hammers. In battle, these tools of war create a crimson mist around berserkers as they dispatch their adversaries as messily as possible.",
            "Even when not in battle, berserkers carry an air of violence. Once Uthuk warriors become berserkers, they have embraced a destiny that can only end in their own bloody demise. Berserkers' only desire is to charge screaming into the midst of the enemy and murder everything within reach until at last they themselves are cut down, to join their victims in a sea of gore."

            "The most powerful of the Uthuk witches and warlocks are known as bloodsisters and nightseers, respectively. Though not part of the Blood Coven, these immensely skilled sorcerers are the true leaders of the Uthuk tribes. Their influence stretches out across the Ru Darklands, reaching wherever the blades of the Uthuk draw blood. Nightseers in particular are skilled in dreamwalking, a discipline of the original Loth K'har peoples, and have preserved this ancient tradition across the centuries. Adept in battle, gifted with supernatural longevity and resilience, and able to control the minds of those around them, few dare stand against them.",
            "Hierarchy among the bloodsisters and nightseers is based upon the favor of the Ynfernael Lords; these witches and warlocks must constantly prove their right to lead, often through torture and murder. The greatest of their number become the mortal representatives of Ynfernael Lords such as Vel'tar Demonblood or Eurth Kel'yr, the Mistress of Bones, and the interests of their masters often become their own.",
            "While all seek vengeance against Terrinoth and its allies, some bloodsisters and nightseers have their own goals, such as dispatching their rivals or bringing the tribes together under a single leader. The nightseer Quin'tar Shymaex, who dreams of larger things than mere conquest of the Land of Steel, is perhaps one of the most infamous of these. Shymaex seeks to take his place among the Ynfernael Lords himself and transform all Uthuk into true demons, a goal that eluded even Llovar."

            "Called Deep Elves for the elaborate networks of tunnels they inhabit, they were drawn underground because of the proliferation of Ynfernael gates beneath the surface. Now these Elves generally only emerge aboveground to hunt for new sources of Ynfernael power or when their crusade against the otherworldly demons forces them to do so. Their endless crusade has drained them of any dregs of mercy or compassion, however, as the dark powers they use to fight the Ynfernael slowly poisons their souls. Many adventurers who stray into these underground lairs are lucky to escape with their lives, for the Deep Elves do not suffer trespassers or the inquisitive."

            "Almost every race in Mennara has developed its own legions of archers, but few—if any—can match the skill and power of the Deepwood Archers, who take their name from the Deepwood trees unique to the forests of the Aymhelin. Their nigh-magical longbows, formed of laminated layers of venerated wood from the cores of ancient branches, are unrivaled in strength and flexibility. They draw smoother, fire harder, and break less often than any other bow in the land.",
            "However, it is more than simply these weapons that makes the Deepwood Archers feared adversaries. They are trained from childhood to draw and control their unrivaled bows, so by the time they are of fighting age, they are capable of firing at a rate and accuracy that few can match—even if using a bow one-third the strength.",
            "The Deepwood Archers take exceptional pride in their abilities, a confidence that often drifts into high-handed arrogance—especially when dealing with bowmen in other lands. When they are not serving as guards within the ranks of the Starplain Archers, the Blythwth Arethyl, or the Deepwood Rangers, they seek to participate in bowyer contests, instruct other Elven archers, and locate more impressive game than can be found in the Thalian Glades."

It is not without cause that many tales of Al-Kalim warn against treating with them. All are skilled sorcerers, but even should their magic fail them, Djinni can take on gigantic forms to dispatch foes with great falchions or daggerlike claws.",
            "Many Djinni dream of reclaiming empires, and heroes might find themselves their unwitting pawns. Djinni also lurk behind many enemies heroes might face as they unravel the threads of plots against the Caliphs. Of particular interest to Djinni is the recovery of the secrets stolen from them by the Collegiate Arcane and as immortal beings they can spend years scheming and plotting, perhaps to recover a single artifact or to arrange the theft of a glowing blue stone."

            "Dragon hybrids are cruel abominations, relics from the age of the Third Darkness. They are the result of depraved experiments of the most inventive draconic invaders, who required loyal servants with both the cunning of Humans and the resiliency and magic of dragon-kind.",
            "The results of these experiments were largely deemed miserable failures, as dragon hybrids were neither as strong as dragons nor as intelligent as them (or even Humans). They served as foot soldiers and were discarded after the end of the Dragon Wars, left to fend for themselves in the wilds of Terrinoth.",
            "Raised in the harshest life imaginable, dragon hybrids are vicious fighters, and time has only made them deadlier. Some possess wings, others deadly talons, and still others a hint of the fiery breath so commonly associated with their larger draconic ancestors. Like dragons, they have a hunger for magic in all its forms. As such, hybrids often delve into Terrinoth's many ruins, or sell their swords to sorcerers and wizards willing to pay their price in magical artifacts. In recent years, they have become more accepted in Dragonkin society, and fight alongside other Dragonkin as inheritors of Margath's legacy."

The ten guilds cover a wide range of knowledge, abilities, and traditions, and so guild members are ideal sources of information for visitors. Depending on the guild, they can be excellent weapon forgers and repairers, decipherers of mysterious runes, and even scouts and fighters. For tired adventurers, though, members of the Brewers' Guild may be the most welcome to locate."

            "The Dwarven Dragon Hunters are hostile, rage-filled, proselytizing zealots who give every aspect of their lives to the hunt of their ancestral foes. They train endlessly in a specialized style of combat most effectively suited to ending the lives of dragons wherever they can be found, then make pilgrimages to places that report sightings of the beasts. Typically, when Dragon Hunters leave the Dunwarr Mountains, they aggressively try to enlist anyone whom they see as having the makings of an adventurer to join their quest. Refusal results in a barrage of harsh and belittling insults at best, for Dragon Hunters tend to take a dim view of anyone who doesn't hate dragons as enthusiastically as they do. In some cases, they have even taken their blade to anyone seen as \"Dargeth Moni,\" or \"friend of filth-lizards.\""

What is known is that all dragons possess an insatiable appetite for magical objects and can detect magic from hundreds of leagues away. During the Third Darkness, also known as the Dragon Wars, they plundered countless holdings for their magical artifacts, leaving their other treasures untouched or burning them to ash.",

Suffused with magic, dragons are very nearly impossible for the average soldier to kill, and even mighty heroes must rely on the aid of runebound shards to have any hope of slaying the beasts.",

Membranous skin stretched between their arms and torsos allows ferrox to glide, and gives a very bat-like appearance when extended. Their arms terminate in wicked, hook-like claws, and their mouths are filled with razor-like teeth. Vicious and savage, these creatures are only dimly intelligent, and easily dominated by certain dark magics.",

            "Flesh rippers are the heralds of the Uthuk armies: packs of these slavering beasts lead the charge into battle with savage roars and screams. There can be little doubt as to the demonic ancestry of these twisted creatures given their blood-red sinew, bulging muscles, and bony, armored hides. As large as fullgrown lions, flesh rippers tower over most prey. Their size, however, belies their speed. Racing across the ground on all fours, these vicious beasts can easily catch a knight on horseback, while soldiers on foot have no hope of outrunning them. When flesh rippers catch their foes, they truly live up to their name; even a single such monster will paint the earth red as it rends apart its prize. Of course, when one sees a single flesh ripper, others are never far behind.",
            "The wrangling of flesh rippers is no easy task, as Uthuk beastmasters' countless old scars and missing limbs can prove. Witches and warlocks use blood sacrifice to lure the flesh rippers from the tempestuous heart of the Ru and cage them with sorcerous power. The demons are then branded with the N'klashth, or bloodmark, making the covenant of ownership complete. Once the creatures are broken to the will of the Blood Coven, beastmasters use barbed whips to corral them. Then, when the horns of war sound and the beasts are let loose, their instincts takes over, and their masters need only prod them toward the foe and watch the carnage they unleash."

The largest of the animated trees of the Aymhel, they march forward with a fearless abandon, lashing out with their \"legs\" and using the dense gnarl of their branches and trunks to smash and crush anything that stands before them. Forest Guardians are preternaturally strong, have the inherent resilience of a dense hardwood tree, and act with an efficient brutality borne of beings who may be utterly divorced from the constraints of traditional mortality. They almost never stride beyond the great forest, however, though some have been seen in large battles against Broken Plains Orc invaders or Uthuk raiding parties."

Despite the relatively small sizes of its islands, much of the Torue Albes is still unexplored, and giants can still be discovered within enormous underground caverns or wading through deep marshes and lakes in search of prey",
            "Luckily, giants are relatively slow, though their long strides more than compensate. Cunning or magic are the weapons of choice when facing these immense foes, for attempting to match them in brute strength or common weaponry likely ends with a fresh gravestone to mark yet another adventurer's death."

Most are more than capable of defending themselves, however, with runic bolts of fire or lightning. Some can even channel rune magic into the ground, causing limbs of soil and stone to rise up and smash their enemies. For many adventurers, though, it is their knowledge that is most desired. Scholars of Greyhaven are privy to the mysteries concerning the runebound shards and how they came into the world, and they can offer much to those desiring to know more of the arcane."

Grotesques are monstrosities, each a uniquely horrid form that only vaguely resembles the Uthuk they once were. Having offered themselves up for sacrifice to the Blood Coven, they have hacked off limbs, given over eyes, or even torn out their own beating heart in hopes of receiving the witches' Ynfernael blessing.",

Bone ridges begin to cover their body, their hunched back becoming a forest of razor-sharp spines while their muscles swell and distort under their pale flesh. Gone are the vestiges of mortality from their face, elongated fangs and glowing red eyes marking them as the beast they have become.",
            "In battle, the grotesques are the lumbering elite of the Uthuk tribes, many rising to become warlords of their own raiding armies or wasteland fortresses. Horrendously strong in combat, grotesques can rip a person apart with their bare hands, carve them up with their bone spines, and even fling bone shards from their fists to fell enemies at a distance. Few bother to carry weapons or wear armor, as their demonically transformed bodies are able to take and dish out enormous amounts of punishment.",
            "More monstrous than mortal, the mutated blood that fills grotesques and grants them their strength and resilience often comes with other gifts. A supernatural terror clings to them, making combatants who wouldn't normally flee before their grotesque size and appearance find their nerve undone. This panic can become infectious: just one of these towering horrors can send a disciplined force into a rout. Grotesques grow intoxicated upon the outpouring of fear, rising to a killing frenzy as they fall upon their fleeing foes."

Generally, they tend to rely on their teeth and the claws on their lead fore-legs at the start of combat. Once their prey is wounded and the Gurak feels bold enough to take its eyes off their enemy, though, they swing their massive tails with the force of a trebuchet's ball upon the target's skull or spine. Their tails also allow them to perform a ranged attack when an Orc outrider provides suitable ammunition.",
            "Gurak Tols have been captured and \"domesticated\" into becoming Orc steeds, but there are still many wild herds that occupy the Broken Plains. While the Orcs actively seek out Gurak Tols for new mounts, they also protect the great lizards from outsiders lest their numbers diminish."

            "As cold as the lands in which they crawl, ice wyrms are truly beings of ice and snow. Dimly related to the great dragons of ancient times, they are creations of the Rime Storm, their blood cold enough to freeze flesh. Covered in glittering diamond scales, each like a huge icy mirror, ice wyrms move across the snow, dazzling enemies just before they strike. Long, icicle-like fangs and wickedly sharp claws make swift work of their victims, while the wyrms' spines are sharp enough to slice a Human in two.",
            "Ice wyrms, like their dragon ancestors, are deeply dangerous foes. Conversant in many dark tongues, these beings have enslaved or bargained with most of the monstrous races of the north, enlisting them in their unending war against the remnants of the Salishwyrd. Many grow great wings of cold leather, and silently glide over the glaciers in search of prey. Some ice wyrms even practice sorcery and are able to spit spells as well as streams of freezing blood. Scarsha the Vile, Queen of the ice wyrms, is perhaps the most deadly of her kind. Heroes who wander into the far north are likely to find themselves drawing her gaze, whether as potential adversaries, prey, or tools in her hunt for the Green Vale."

            "The White Death is an insidious effect of the Rime Storm that can claim those unfortunates who traverse Isheim's northern wilds. For some, the White Death merely kills, leaving their frozen corpses contorted in their final moments of death. For others, it can be even worse, transmuting their once-warm blood into icy fluid. Their veins filled with sorcerous cold, they become sadistic killers, preying upon any being or creature that crosses their path. Raging and cursing, these frozen beings are drawn to the warmth of hot-blooded creatures so they might quench the heat with their eternal cold. Fighting off such adversaries is a terrible struggle; even their touch can blacken flesh with frostbite.",
            "As the cold does not affect them anymore, wild clans of ice-blood warriors plague the silent forests and endless tundra of the north, their white eyes unblinking as they search for warm prey. While the ice-blood warriors are perils of the north, heroes might seek them out regardless. Like that of ice wyrms and wendigo, their blood has value. Further, rumor has it that there is magic that can bring an individual back from this icy fate, giving hope to those who have lost loved ones to the White Death."

This can prove useful for travelers who run afoul of Nerekhall's many laws against uncivil behavior or its antimagic ordinances (or who merely cross the wrong noble) and face the wrath of these metal guardians."

They live for battle in the claustrophobic, fortified tunnels under the mountains—employing the unconventional, unpredictable strategies of guerrilla warriors. Whether they are tunneling deep behind invaders' flanks, collapsing mine shafts, or choking their foes in noxious gasses from the Alchemists' League, there are none better at tunnel fighting in all the world."

            "Centuries ago, a sorcerer desperately in need of minions used magic to twist a race of beastmen to suit his own depraved purposes. He made them smaller so they could better work in tight spaces, slashed their intelligence so they would never revolt against him, made them genderless so they wouldn't be distracted by mating instincts, and gave them the ability to reproduce asexually so they would always have large enough numbers for their tasks. He was an exceptionally powerful magician whose intellect was matched only by his lack of foresight.",
            "The kobolds reproduced at an astonishing rate, and they soon overwhelmed the wizard, his stronghold, and the surrounding lands. Luckily, being small and about as bright a particularly dim dog, they tend to fall prey to anything higher up on the food chain (which includes just about everything). Even so, they remain a blight on every corner of Mennara. Occasionally, a kobold may figure out how to construct simple traps, make rudimentary weapons, or even lead a group of their fellows in some semblance of tactics, at which point a pack of kobolds can go from nuisance to menace. They carry out raids on isolated villages or farms, hunting for fresh(ish) meat, shiny baubles, and small domesticated animals.",
            "Packs of kobolds infest the Dunwarr Mountains, and the Dwarves view them as the rest of the world does—annoying, predatory vermin. One of the Rangers' and Warriors' Guilds' more onerous duties is kobold extermination, which usually falls on the newest members."

Charging into battle atop the ferocious Leonx, large sentient felines native to the Aymhelin, these Elven warriors pierce through enemy lines with the force of a storm, using their lightning speed to evade counterblows and change their angles of attack with the swiftness of a gale.",
            "Many Elves see the nomadic Leonx Riders as little more than feral barbarians who have lost their connection to the teachings of Latariana and the Path of the Stars. Far from unthinking savages, the Free Hunters (as they were called in ancient days) saw their wild nature as a way to better attune themselves with the wild lands around them.",
            "In time, they learned to temper their tremendous skill for hunting and combat with a deeper wisdom gained from their animal family. The mightiest killed only to survive, and the pack went to war only in defense of their own. Over time, songs were sung in Caelcira of lost Latari children rescued from the wild by strange, feral Elves, or even whole villages saved by Elven nomads who could speak the tongues of animals. Nevertheless, some of the most prominent leaders of the Latari noble houses wished to exile these \"barbarians\" from their sacred forest. Still shunned by the rest of Latari society, the Leonx Riders now keep mostly to themselves and their pack, only making contact with outsiders to offer aid."

            "When the Lords of Bilehall discarded their humanity to join Waiqar, they tied their fates to that of his. They became immensely more powerful as the corrupting mists covered their lands and they rose in undeath. Today, they are an arrogant line, besotted from centuries of indulging in their every desire, exulting in the pleasures of immortality. Each has become a ruler in their own right, and even the lowest vampire of the line of Bilehall can claim a crypt-fortress as their own.",
            "The ages have made the Lords of Bilehall both shrewd and knowledgeable. Some have dedicated themselves to necromancy, even gaining enough power to raise lesser Reanimates. Still others have become masters of warfare and lead raids on the baronies to the south or even into Dunwarr and other realms. It is rare to encounter such creatures without powerful minions to defend them, but such is their hubris that they fear little except Waiqar himself and may step forth alone to toy with those who dare venture into their domains. For an adventurer to survive such an occurrence is even rarer, for Lords such as Kyndrithul and Vorun'thul have had hundreds of years to set traps, arrange countermeasures, and prepare themselves for almost any enemy."

Records indicate not all of the company made it to what would become the city of Lorim, as some gave up on the trek and their new lord. Tavern tales in the Albes speculate these figures may still be questing across Lorimor in search of rights to wrong, hoping one day to one day be allowed to achieve a final rest."

            "Makhim warriors are as fierce as any in Zanaga, and they have adapted to the environments they fight in. Most employ weapons that only a four-armed fighter could wield, like the dagger-like dolochs they wear a gauntlets. They also employ leather slings which they twist and swing to send a missile flying with tremendous momentum. Makhim are seldom encountered alone; they usually travel in great war parties, some scouting ahead, others staying to the shadows. At first glance, their opponents might believe they face but a few of the reptilian creatures, at least until the jungle comes alive with a cacophony of hissing war cries."

Such theories tend to involve drunken mages and spells gone horribly wrong. Unfortunately, the fierce nature of these creatures means there are very few opportunities to study them.",
            "Manticores appear to be not only perpetually hungry but vicious as well, especially those that fly across the western islands. They take delight in each raking claw that draws blood and each stinging stab of their insectoid tail. Many foes learn far too late that the creatures can also hurl volleys of spikes from their tails, which can puncture armor to deliver deadly venoms. Some alchemists who have studied the venoms claim they have traces of magical properties, but proof of this has not yet been established. Sadly, no reliable antivenom has been developed, either."

            "Among Mennara's aquatic beasts, few elicit as much terror and dread as the merriod. Sailors and pirates in Shellport taverns swear it is the last vengeance of a dead sea god, one who cursed the world with an avatar borne of its own unfathomable malice. Combining the jaws of the shark, the grasping tentacles of the kraken, and the cleverness of the octopus, the god unleashed the merriod into the waters.",
            "Thankfully, these amphibious beasts are relatively rare, slow to reproduce, and often simply slumber in their dark, damp lairs. When stirred by hunger or some darker motivation, however, merriods become one of the most dangerous predators adventurers can face. They are especially adept at luring or driving their targets places where they can entrap or encircle them, such as a dank cavern or flooded dungeon.",
            "Merriods often use their mawed tentacles to stealthily grasp an adventurer and pull them down to a watery grave, but the creatures are also formidable when confronted in open battle. They move with a speed that belies their bulk, their great jaws allow them to bite clean through armor, and their thick hide can ward off the mightiest blows."

            "Necromancy is forbidden as the darkest of all possible magical arts, one that corrupts the wielder and brings ruin to those who allow it to fester. Though they may try to hide their acts, necromancers are usually found out as they are spurred on to greater acts of desecration or as their bodies become more noticeably twisted by the demands necromancy places upon living flesh. Those who survive discovery invariably find themselves in the Mistlands, wandering from crypt to crypt in search of either a patron or enough untouched dead to raise into protective retinues.",
            "Necromancers who wander long enough eventually arrive at Zorgas, their own magic drawing them to the foul power within it. Here, they can become servants to Waiqar and possibly go on to operate his Engines of Entropy. Those who refuse service are usually fed into the engines instead, unless they successfully flee to continue their unholy work elsewhere.

From their new lairs, they can grow networks of minions (living as well as undead) to further their unholy goals."

            "The diminutive Onoit shamans are one of Isheim's many mysteries. Ostensibly, they are part of the nomadic Gnomish tribes. Clad in cloaks of bark and moss, they are frequently seen moving among their people, healing and dispensing wisdom. Yet, they often travel alone in their sled-tents, drawn across the tundra by packs of trusty Ulfen. A society unto themselves, the Onoit shamans serve as guardians of the lost Salishwyrd empire. When the Elves retreated to the Green Vale, they entrusted the keeping of their abandoned cities and tombs to the Onoit shamans, granting each one a spark of elemental magic to light their way. Since that time, those sparks have been passed from shaman to shaman.",
            "Onoit shamans are enemies of the Rime Storm and the White Death it brings. Heroes traversing their lands might be recruited by these traveling Gnome mystics in their war against winter's soldiers—ice wyrms, wendigo, and ice-blood warriors. Equally, those who seek to plunder the lost realm of the Salishwyrd will find the land and sky set against them, as the shamans bend the elements to their will to make an icy tomb for any would-be looters."

            "Lizard riders from the Great Beast Clan, the Mag Ugluk Urak are mounted warriors who are as dangerous as any cavalry in Mennara. Nomadic Orcs who follow elk and other wild game across the Broken Plains, they tend to lead fairly simple lives as hunters and gatherers. Following their chieftain's noble example, the Mag Ugluk Urak are brutally honest and always good to their word. They will never cheat during a trade, stab an ally in the back, or abandon a pledge. If that pledge is to kill an adversary or slaughter an enemy, then one of the two are absolutely going to die.",
            "Typically armed with axes and throwing spears, and trained to make hit and run attacks at high speeds, outriders are at their best when mounted on their Gurak Tol steeds. These Orcs make life-bonds with their mounts, something that forms as an outrider personally captures one of the huge lizards. Gurak Tols are never fully tamed though, and outriders take care to avoid getting too close to their always hungry mouths.",
            "Outriders eventually discovered that their steeds could also provide ranged support, via their powerful tails. Thus the opening minutes of any large-scale battle finds outriders dismounted next to their Gurak Tol, nudging the beasts in the proper direction, placing a skullsized rock into brackets mounted onto those bony tails, and then having the beast hurl the stone overhead. Depending on the age and strength of the Gurak Tol, these improvised projectiles can be thrown at incredible speeds up to a hundred paces, and at a rate of fire that can wreak havoc on enemy formations and often causes undisciplined units to break and flee.",
            "Then, as the battle shifts or the Orcs run out of ammunition, the Outriders mount their giant lizards and execute intricately choreographed strafing runs across the enemy's front lines; carefully maintaining an ideal distance that brings the deadly throwing spears into range but carefully keeps the duo beyond the reach of the enemy's own hurled projectiles."

            "Magic users unique to the Orcish race, spiritspeakers use a shamanistic connection through the earth to communicate with the hidden, ethereal creatures of Mennara. This not only allows them to speak as mediums for The Unseen, but also to act as conduits for the spirits to act on the mundane world.",
            "Whether attached to objects or locations, minor spirits are normally unable to summon the energy or focus it takes to act on the physical world. However, through a combination of natural ability and rigorous training, spiritspeakers can thin the barriers that surround Mennara enough to allow apparitions to manifest. That lets benevolent sprites openly share their wisdom, guardian spirits to physically defend their territories, and wraiths to directly attack whoever holds their cursed object.",
            "That connection also gives spiritspeakers a supernatural edge in combat and adventuring, as many will have gathered a modest assortment of objects with useful entities attached which can be summoned for aid or protection."

            "Pirates have a dual identity. On one hand, they are reviled as despoilers and scourges who prowl the waterways, little better than thieves and murderers. On the other hand, on their voyages, they often discover new lands to be exploited and rising threats to be repelled. Despite their wicked deeds, most also operate in an honorable fashion and offer better payments and a more democratic operation than official navies. Many pirates are consummate businesspeople, inking deals to privateer or act as smugglers in exchange for amnesty. It's a difficult balancing act, and those who cannot master it rarely remain alive for long.",
            "In combat, pirates tend to favor flashy, quick styles learned in seaside taverns and outlaw towns rather than the formalized martial arts of mainland knights and soldiers. On a ship's deck, one tumble over the side can turn even the lightest armor into a death sentence, so most go without. Trickery is also a staple of the pirate fighting style, and anything from smoke bombs to feigning wounds will be employed if it means an edge in a fight."

This can be as simple as conjuring mystical flame around their hand or weapon, or casting out gouts of living flame to consume their foes. Their flames can also heal, and some have claimed they can even resurrect the dead, though this must surely be myth. Encountering these priests is often a double-edged sword; they can offer aid to the sick and dying but may also serve as an indication that the undead or other dangers are nearby."

            "The Dragonkin known as salamanders lack the intelligence and arcane power of true dragons, but are nonetheless fearsome creatures and the foundation for countless legends. Salamanders are creatures of magic, although they lack the requisite intelligence to consciously master this power. Heat radiates from their smooth reptilian bodies and the creatures seem particularly suited for life in the Heath—few other environments could tolerate their inflammatory presence.",
            "Salamanders live extraordinarily long and sedentary lives. Every few decades, a salamander seeks out a rift or vent in the broken terrain, rejuvenating itself in the magma below the surface. While largely peaceable, they blaze with violence if threatened, especially if any dare disturb their fiery nests. Salamander eggs (and skins) are highly desirable to mages and scholars for their magical properties, and can fetch staggering prices in Tamalir markets."

            "None are sure why these spirits are so common in Tigh Higard. They can certainly be found in other lands, but on this island there are few cemeteries or other resting places from which scholars of such things would expect shades to rise. To walk about on certain nights is to watch echoes of the dead float across the grasses, ghastly blue-white forms that undulate despite the stillness of the air.",
            "Their touch is as cold as the grave, and should they find magical aid or be invigorated with sorcerous magics, they can become powerful enough to overrun settlements and fully crewed ships alike. Longtime residents of Shellport claim they are searching for the pirates who betrayed them and offer rewards in barnacle-encrusted gold coins to those who offer assistance, but if any have done so, they have not lived to speak of such deeds."

            "The feline ancestry of the Singhara makes them excellent hunters. In the darkness of night, when their night sight gives them an edge over their prey, they move swiftly and silently across the plains and through the jungles. The favored weapon of these hunters is the lion spear, a shaft as long as a warrior is tall, tipped with a sharpened sabrecat tooth. In the hands of a Singhara hunter, such a spear can punch through toughened hide or shell and be launched into the air like a bolt of bone lightning to strike down targets hundreds of paces distant.",
            "Singhara hunters often travel in packs, all the better to herd animals to their doom. Singhara can outdistance even a galloping horse, their tireless stamina carrying them on while their echoing roars coordinate the hunt. While some of the warriors form the pursuit, others pick out good spots for ambush or places to corral their prey. For all their swiftness, when Singhara choose to lie in wait—often from the branches of a tree or hidden in tall grass—they become almost invisible until they burst into a blinding sprint, then enjoy the bloody victory of the kill."

            "Pridelords are the largest and fiercest of the Singhara warriors. Powerfully muscled, they stand head and shoulders above even the tallest of Humans. Adding to their grandeur are their great manes, which hang like cloaks down their backs, the size and thickness a mark of a war chief's status among their people. Armed with spear, club, tooth, and claw, the Pridelord is always at the forefront of the hunt or where battle is at its thickest, for it is the Singhara way to lead by example. As a mark of this bravery, a Pridelord's body is often covered in scars, each one worn proudly to tell a tale of the chief's life as a warrior and veteran of war.",
            "Swift hunters, Pridelords can race across the wilds of Zanaga, their long legs and mighty muscles allowing them to run down almost any kind of prey. Despite such speed, though, their deafening roars precede them into battle. So great is the growl of a Pridelord that the very ground shakes with its booming, and weak-hearted creatures are set to flight. By contrast, nearby Singhara warriors are stirred to greater acts of animalistic savagery, their own roars joining those of their leader as they tear into their prey."

The men and women who perish in the impact or drown swiftly are the fortunate ones, for those survivors who wash ashore or climb upon the rocks become living prey for the sirens—twisted creatures combining the features of humans and birds. The hypnotic song of these creatures is unique, with qualities of both birdsong and the most beautiful human voices. Few can resist the lure of the sirens' song, and those who succumb find themselves compelled to seek its source, and helpless to defend themselves against the sirens' attack.",
            "Sirens are intelligent, but are completely without mercy or culture. These cannibalistic monsters see humans and other intelligent races as nothing more than food, yet they prefer to inflict as much misery as possible on their prey. Sirens are as spiteful as they are craven, quick to flee should their victims fight back, but equally quick to return when they believe their prey to be vulnerable once more. In some rare cases, sirens have been known to pursue victims who escape back to outposts of civilization."

            "Known to the Uthuk as the Gw'reth Chuik, or \"that which feeds,\" these mighty demons are simply \"spined threshers\" to the defenders of the Land of Steel. When the enemies of the Uthuk cower behind the stone walls of their cities and keeps, the witches call out into the Ynfernael for the Gw'reth Chuik. If their sacrifices are sufficient, a huge demon hauls its chitinous form from the beyond to do battle for the Locust Swarm.",
            "A nightmare mixture of insect and beast, the demon looms over Humans and horses. These monsters range from the size of a laden wagon to that of a small house. Despite their bulk, spined threshers move swiftly across the battlefield, their many legs propelling them along. They rip apart their foes with serrated mandibles or even devour them whole, while walls and other fortifications crack and crumble under their sustained assaults.",
            "The mere sight of a spined thresher is frequently enough to infect mortal minds with unreasoning fear. As the beast chitters and lifts its bulbous head above the enemy's parapet, soldiers scatter before it, dropping weapons and shields as they try desperately to flee. The demon seems to revel in the terror is causes, displaying a dark intelligence as it drives prey before it. Often it will trap them against their own defenses before taking its time to crush them underfoot or snip the limbs from their bodies.",
            "In great battles, a favored bloodsister might be blessed with the arrival of more than one spined thresher with which to destroy her enemies. In these instances, the great demons level everything in their path, competing to sow the most destruction until naught remains of a city or town but piles of rubble and twisted corpses."

            "Goblin hierarchy is a simple thing: the biggest goblin is the leader. Though the title of \"King,\" \"Queen,\" or \"Monarch\" might be a stretch, there can be no doubt that these larger goblins can pose a serious threat to even seasoned adventurers.",
            "Splig, the self-styled \"King of All Goblins,\" is one such goblin. Taller than his minions by several heads, and several hundred pounds heavier, Splig embodies the two major virtues of goblin-kind: cowardice and avarice. Using his large size and brutal demeanor, he intimidates his goblin lackeys into running headlong into readied enemy weapons, and he has even been known to grab one to use as a living shield when an adventurer's blade comes too close. Should things even hint at going badly, he quickly retreats—all the while calling for his minions to keep fighting to the end.",
            "Like many goblins, Splig harbors grand ambitions that far surpass his worldly ability. Forever wandering from county to county and from cave hideout to cave hideout, he has never wanted for absurd schemes to gain gold and power. Splig often serves as discreet muscle for necromancers and dark wizards who do not wish to draw the attention of the holy warriors of Kellos; he usually accepts such jobs in hopes of stealing whatever he can and quietly slipping out the back when adventurers inevitably show up."

They are not given a sword, though, until they have learned to also compose and sing while fighting. They are reflective and observant, seeking meaning in every duel. If two sword poets are in set to duel each other, they may spend hours in combative verse until the moment is right to draw blades—lighting, ambient sounds, and mood must all be perfect. For them, a fight without art is one not worth having.",
            "Once their blade is drawn, however, each sword poet becomes a flurry of slashes. Their techniques may seem flamboyant, but the results speak for themselves. Few actually strike to kill, though; most prefer to disarm or otherwise avoid the unseemliness of spilling blood, often likened to carelessly spilling ink upon a blank page. Only if they know the blow will be absolutely perfect will they consider striking to kill. These deadly codas are renowned and often recorded for posterity, the most famous compilation being blade-laureate Zaff Darba's masterwork {@i Contemplations upon the Flametail}."

            "The guilds of Tamalir wield a tremendous amount of power; a council of Guildmasters governs the city and its surrounding territories. Guildmasters are tasked with overseeing some part of their guild's business or their guild in its entirety. In either case, they jealously guard their power and make life very difficult for any who cross them.",
            "Drawing the ire of any of Tamalir's Guildmasters can make one's life suddenly difficult, often without the source being apparent. All a traveler might know is that prices are raised unexpectedly, porters become unruly, or meals acquire an upsetting flavor. Bloodshed is bad for business, so nonviolent methods are the first course of action when Guildmasters wish to remove a troublesome opponent. This can be anything from a complete denial of a guild's services to a decree of outright banishment beyond the city limits.",
            "While Guildmasters may not seem the most intimidating of opponents, they rarely travel (or fight) alone, keeping several burly apprentices around to deal with dustups. Thanks to the extensive treasuries and personal armories of the individual guildhalls, Guildmasters are usually well equipped and thus fear little within their city."

            "The thieves' guild holds great power in AlKalim, and its cutpurses are everywhere within the Caliphate. They come in many forms, from filthy street urchins and beggars feigning debilitating injuries to well-dressed merchants and offspring of the nobility, as the strength of a good thief is often the ability to get close to a target without raising suspicions. These nefarious robbers are most often found in taverns and markets where crowds are at their thickest, although daring individuals can operate wherever there is wealth for the taking. The guild takes a dim view of \"freelancers\" in its territory, so most cutpurses are accounted for. They are marked with the guild's tattoo and must tithe a measure of their take to the local den bosses.",
            "Many cutpurses work in teams, one or more distracting the mark while the others relieve them of their money. A victim who turns on a cutpurse might be in for a nasty surprise when they are led on a chase into a blind alley containing a dozen or so of the cutpurse's companions. Guild thieves are not above using clubs, blades, and fists to obtain what deception and quick fingers could not."

From a distance, one might mistakenly believes that their form and proportions make them similar to the Humanoid races in Mennara. This is purely a trick, however, of a mind unable to process what, exactly, it is seeing.",
            "The Fae are utterly terrifying. Their appearance varies wildly, but tales are told of distorted nostrils that lead to wide maws filled with razor-sharp teeth. Their horns and antlers are said to jut at unpredictable angles from their skull in ways none of the many monsters that wander the countryside can match. Most disturbing are the sightless visages some are claimed to posses; how they see without eyes is a mystery.",
            "But the thing that makes the Fae truly unique, and utterly terrifying, is the chaotic magical energy that burns inside them. Although there is no shortage of reasons to stay away from the Fae whenever possible, it's ultimately their unpredictable, chaotic power that sends shivers up a being's spine and warns the primitive, instinctive part of their brain to run whenever they are near.",
            "Nevertheless, foolhardy mortals often seek out the Fae in places where the veil between worlds grows thin, such as the Greywood. Some beings are attracted by the promise of power that the Fae represent. Others seek to slay the Fae for their valuable organs, used to make rare tinctures and potions. Still more believe that the Fae are simply misunderstood: that the right person could become the foundation of a new relationship between the Fae and Mennara.",

            "Uthuk warriors are natural raiders, and none more so than the viper legion archers. As befits the vile ways in which the Uthuk wage war, members of the viper legion make extensive use of sorcerous poisons to tip their arrows. Brewed by the viper war leaders and blessed by the Blood Coven, these toxic elixirs are often tailored to the enemy's weaknesses. Heroes' Bane works against a foe's courage so as to kill the brave faster than the cowardly, while Nightshood is made from the powdered remains of powerful undead and can steal an enemy's sight. Perhaps the deadliest of all is the Kiss of Set, crafted from the distilled blood of a naga, which turns the target's heart into a bomb, bursting from their body and leaving a toxic cloud in their wake.",
            "For their arrows to do their work, viper legion archers train constantly amid the storm-lashed wastes of the Darklands, testing their hunting skills on vicious beasts and hapless travelers. In this manner, each legion archer becomes a master of ambush and mobile warfare, striking swiftly with surprise and then vanishing again before their foes can retaliate.",
            "For full-scale battles, the Uthuk mass their viper legion archers, favoring overwhelming force against the benefits of lone hunters. When the archers loose their arrows, the skies darken with writhing forms, and the din of battle is momentarily drowned out by the long hiss of a hundred serpentine arrows hungry for blood."

            "The rugged peoples of the north are as fearsome as the land they call home. Known as the Weik, they have carved out a civilization on the shores of Isheim and won a reputation as daring seafarers, skilled game hunters, and deadly raiders. Their warriors stride into battle with a blade or axe in each hand, wild grins upon their faces—for in the culture of the Weik, there can be no greater honor than to die by the sword. Cold and hardship mean little to them, and they look upon the Human knights and soldiers of Terrinoth as weakling southerners. Some Weik even travel to these warmer lands in search of greater adventure or to hunt a foe who dares think they can escape the wrath of a Weik who has been wronged.",
            "Heroes dealing with the Hearthlords will almost certainly find themselves interacting with Weik warriors as well, either to earn their trust with shows of martial skill, or to join their hunting parties as they seek out the ice-blood creatures of Isheim."

            "Wendigo are also creations of the Rime Storm. According to the tales, they were once the feline mounts of the Salishwyrd, back when the north encompassed green forests and open plains. Then, the Rime Storm infected them with icy magic. Their eyes shrank away to nothing, and a hunger as keen as the howling tundra wind filled their bellies. It was not long before they became a terror of the north, their chilling cries sending sensible creatures scurrying for their dens and wise individuals reaching for their weapons. Eyeless, these creatures bite the air to gain a sense of their prey; they can pinpoint a target's location far swifter than the keenest of hunters.",
            "Many wendigo are servants of the ice wyrms, as a frigid arcane link binds each together. The wyrms use these terrible beasts as trackers and assassins that seek out intruders into their realm. Skulking among the shadows, ready to pounce upon their prey, wendigo also serve as guard dogs for ice wyrm lairs. Ice-blood warrior clans might fight alongside wendigo, though the warriors have little control over their savage allies. Many wild wendigo inhabit the north, too, and these creatures are usually fiercely territorial. An expedition might wander into their hunting grounds without realizing it—at least until the beasts start stalking them and picking off their members one by one."

            "Witches and warlocks are the spiritual slave masters of the Uthuk tribes and the keepers of their dark Ynfernael magic. Only a handful of Uthuk are born with such gifts. These children often arrive into the world amid a portentous rain of blood or storm of crimson lightning. A long and torturous road follows; not all of them live to master their magic, as the brutality of Uthuk society ruthlessly weeds out the weak. Those who survive are cruel and skilled sorcerers and priestesses, utterly dedicated to the Uthuk and without a shred of mercy for their enemies.",
            "Most common among their kind are the bloodwitches, for whom the cardinal fluids of the body are theirs to command. A bloodwitch can hear the blood of her enemies as it pumps through their veins and read the future by gazing into the crimson torrent of a fresh-made wound. With a gesture, she can spark a person's heart aflame, setting their blood to boiling until it bursts forth from their screaming mouth. In contrast, warlocks of the Uthuk are masters of dark dreams. They travel the Aenlong as they sleep, hunting foes, speaking with demons, and summoning horrors into the world.",
            "Kin to bloodwitches, bonewitches manipulate skeletons, often while they are encased in living flesh. Foes can find their limbs snapped like twigs, while allies can be hardened against harm, the witch thickening ribs and skulls to ward away blows.",
            "Revered leaders among their kind, both witches and warlocks are able to communicate telepathically with other Uthuk across vast distances. These links bind the Uthuk tribes together and are used to call their armies to battle, bringing both berserkers and warlords alike to heel with but a hateful glance."

            "Despite the fearsome nature of Waiqar's forces, none of them are as dreaded as wraiths. Whether they existed before the Undying One claimed the Mistlands, or are beings he created with his own arcane powers, is a matter of much debate with both peasants and wizards alike. Perhaps only who do know with certainty are those who serve the Thirteenth Baron.",
            "Several Greyhaven scholars who dare study such matters believe wraiths are the manifestations of tragic or violent deaths involving dark emotions, ones so powerful that death itself could not still the intense hate, passion, or jealousy involved. And so, they say, such spirits rise after the corpse falls, ghastly flowing forms far more destructive than mere shades. They especially turn their ire towards any who would disturb them as they haunt decaying deathbeds, ancient battlefields, crumbing treasure vaults, and other places that perhaps had special meaning to their lives (or deaths).",
            "These horrific spectral creatures conjure fear in even the most stouthearted of Daqan knights as they eerily glide over marshes and through bulwarks, bringing the icy cold touch of the grave to whomever they encounter. Often just the sight of a single wraith is enough to send disciplined units screaming in retreat, and many an adventuring band has been reduced to a single gibbering survivor who barely returns to tell their tale."

            "Mennara is known for its many dragonkin that roam over its varied terrain. While most possess deep and ancient wisdoms, some have seemingly devolved into little more than beasts of hunger and fury. The fathomless seas that lay beyond the shores of Lorimor and the Torue Albes are home to one such strain, gigantic creatures that prey on seagoing vessels all along the western coast. Many sightings are reported even in the well-traveled southern waters separating Al-Kalim and Zanaga, a truly frightening occurrence for passengers. Experienced sailors, though, know that the true terrors are the gods that also live in the seas, and would rather face a wyrm any day.",
            "While most vessels desperately seek to put as much distance as possible between a deepwyrm sighting and their own fragile vessels, others actually seek them out these creatures. Wyrm hunters are a breed apart, traveling in packs aboard chartered ships or accompanying merchant ships to offer defence in case of unexpected attacks. These brave individuals have a near ancestral hatred of the wyrms, and will even leap onto the backs of the creatures to ensure they are slain (even though it invariably means their own death). The scales and organs fetch high prices in Tamalir and Al-Medena, where alchemists use them for especially potent potions.",
            "Some scholars (and pirates) firmly believe these creatures are not Dragonkin at all, but some other form of reptilian being perhaps utterly unique to the ocean depths. Those who have dared to venture into the Molten Heath or Isheim to ask the dragons directly have never returned, however."

            "Dragons take decades, even centuries, to fully mature. Unlike the wild dragons of the southern lands, the dragons of the Molten Heath are highly protective of their dragonlings, shielding them from the worst dangers of their homeland until they come of age. During this time, the elder dragons instruct the young in the history of their race, which is the history of all creation.",
            "From a young age, dragons learn of their unique place in the cosmos, as the inheritors of the Yrthwrights' legacy. By the time they reach adulthood, dragons understand the weight of their role as stewards of Mennara and guardians of its inhabitants—at least, most of them do.",
            "Although weak and fragile compared to fully grown dragons, the youngest wyrmling is far from defenseless. A newly hatched dragon might be the size of a small stag, with talons strong and sharp enough to split a warrior open. Within a few years at most, the dragonling stands larger and stronger than an ox. Similarly, although they lack the intense depth of insight and centuries of wisdom of their elders, even the youngest dragons are at least the intellectual equals of the finest minds of Human civilization."

Those calling themselves Free Cities Elves can also include Elves whose bloodline has mingled with that of Humans."

While most of the nearby societies accept such beings for what they are, full-blooded Catfolk see them as the byproducts of unworthy exiles.

A company of soldiers can use the reach of their halberds to prepare for cavalry and still cut through armor with the weapon's axe blade. Still, most of the baronies prefer to equip their armies with the cheaper and simpler spear."

The broad, stabbing blade and horizontal grip allow cutthroats to dispatch their victims with a burst of swift, powerful thrusts."
