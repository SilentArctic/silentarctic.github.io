            "Originally created before the Great War by the government to replace human troops in battle, deathclaws were derived from mixed animal stock, primarily from the very popular Jackson Chameleon. They were then refined by a secret post-war society, using genetic manipulation and the Forced Evolutionary Virus. The resulting creature is incredibly fast and powerful. Around 2161, deathclaws were still considered mysterious and legendary creatures to many. As the Deathclaw population grew and began to spread across the continent, the deathclaws stopped being perceived as legendary beasts, and started to be seen just as another dangerous wasteland creature.",
            "Deathclaws will commonly attack with both claws, or a claw and bite attack. Use the standard rules for two-weapon fighting when doing so.",

            "Robots were a common sight in the pre-War America. They served as security, tour guides, in the military, and even in residential homes. Robots were created in a variety of styles and abilities; some walked, others flew around on hover jets powered by micro fusion fuel. Larger robots used multiple Fusion Cores as power; fusion batteries usually reserved for Power Armor operations. Whether they helped in hospitals, warfare, construction, or doing yardwork, these mechanical marvels where everywhere.",
            "After the War, some robots survived the devastation and still function. Others have been repaired by skilled salvagers and restored to their original purpose, or pressed into service in other areas. Most robots found wandering the Wastelands do so because of a programming error. Some are harmless, while others will attack anything they come across."

After the bombs fell, the project was continued by secret agencies within the former US Government that survived in their own secure Vaults. The result are powerful, 10ft tall hulking brutes that believe themselves to be the pinnacle of human evolution.",
            "The intellect of most Super Mutants diminishes as a result of the transformation, but some do retain their intelligence and charisma. Those super mutants are truly dangerous beings; overlords who are able to attract and lead a formidable force of deadly mutants, capable of annihilating any wasteland community they come across. ",
            "The oldest and strongest Super Mutants may evolve into Behemoths; towering giants over 20 feet tall. These monstrous humanoids lose the ability for speech, and most cognitive function, but are still cunning hunters and deadly foes to anything in the wasteland."

Their skin coloration changes in hue to a shade of grey, green, or yellow. Constitution and strength are greatly enhanced, and the mutant becomes immune to radiation and disease. While the process renders the Super-Mutant sterile, the constant regeneration of cells makes Super Mutants effectively immortal. The mental effects of exposure to FEV are varied; many Super-Mutants lose much of their cognitive abilities. Those that retain their higher reasoning and mental prowess are valuable allies or exceptionally dangerous opponents."

The suit saw continuous use throughout the Great War up until the Cataclysm, and many suits have survived over the centuries. The suit's TX-28 MicroFusion Pack provides exceptional power output, allowing the suit to support a variety of upgrades and optional attachments. Most T-51s were deployed in active duty units around the world when the bombs fell, making the T-51 an uncommon sight in the Wastelands of the United States."

The wasteland world is littered with the artifacts of pre-war America, some useful, but mostly junk. Ramshackle settlements try to make a living in blasted out buildings that somehow have survived 200 years of war, weather, and mutated creatures. Few animals survived unchanged; two-headed cattle and giant mutant insects thrive in vast numbers. Even once-small lizards have grown into apex predators called Deathclaws, a common and deadly hazard in the wastelands."

Atomic energy was everywhere; from power plants that lit up the city at night to fusion powered cars and airliners, even down to small fusion batteries that powered handheld devices. The radioactive by-products of the nuclear age litter the Wasteland. Vast sections of the country are still deadly radioactive hot-zones. Vehicles once powered by the atom lie dormant and rusting, causing their fusion powered engines to leak and sometimes explode in mini-atomic blasts. Vast quantities of radioactive waste were improperly disposed of, allowing toxic sludge to seep into nearby ground-water. Lakes, streams, and even the oceans have a small amount of radiation in them; more so if they contain radioactive waste or a submerged and rusting nuclear-powered car. In all cases, anyone living in the Wasteland must constantly contend with the threat of irradiation."

After World War II, the world advances the power of the atom, and uses up many of its natural resources in the process to create a variety of fusion powered comforts. When resources begin to run dry, hostilities around the world escalate, resulting in a catastrophic nuclear war. Some people managed to survive in the blasted wasteland of Post-war Earth, but others survived by paying for space in large underground Vaults constructed before the Cataclysm, Vaults built by an American corporation called \"Vault-Tec\".",

                              "The Fallout United States diverges slightly from the real world sometime after World War II. The transistor was not invented, but vacuum tubes and atomic physics became the leading edge of technology. This lead to an \"atom-punk golden age,\" with all the socio- and economic ideals of the 1950s marching in step with nuclear powered cars, advanced weapons and armor, robots, and other futuristic technologies. Because of the lack of transistors, technology tends to still be bulky. Cell phones were never invented, nor were small computers. TV monitors use cathode ray tubes, and people still use landline based telephones. The 1950s cold-war era paranoia persisted until the devastating end of the Great War in October, 2077."

The wasteland world is littered with the artifacts of pre-war America, some useful, but mostly junk. Ramshackle settlements try to make a living in blasted out buildings that somehow have survived 200 years of war, weather, and mutated creatures. Few animals survived unchanged; two-headed cattle and giant mutant insects thrive in vast numbers. Even once-small lizards have grown into apex predators called Deathclaws, a common and deadly hazard in the wastelands."

Atomic energy was everywhere; from power plants that lit up the city at night to fusion powered cars and airliners, even down to small fusion batteries that powered handheld devices. The radioactive by-products of the nuclear age litter the Wasteland. Vast sections of the country are still deadly radioactive hot-zones. Vehicles once powered by the atom lie dormant and rusting, causing their fusion powered engines to leak and sometimes explode in mini-atomic blasts. Vast quantities of radioactive waste were improperly disposed of, allowing toxic sludge to seep into nearby ground-water. Lakes, streams, and even the oceans have a small amount of radiation in them; more so if they contain radioactive waste or a submerged and rusting nuclear-powered car. In all cases, anyone living in the Wasteland must constantly contend with the threat of irradiation."

This has led to a great re-purposing of a wide variety of salvaged items; as street sign might be turned into a chopping weapon, a gardening tool, or an armored breastplate. A car's hood could now be a table, window shutter, or a shield. Cables from an old telephone pole could now support a catwalk in a city, hold together a section of a defensive wall, or utilize their original purpose and carry power from one place to the next.",

Computer terminals still store data on old memory tapes, and can control a variety of machines scattered throughout the ruins of America. Even the mighty Power Armor suits of the US Military and various private security contractors can be found and brought back to life with a charged fusion battery.",

Many of these Vaults suffered mechanical failures or social hardships during their time in isolation (some accidental, others intended as a part of Vault-Tec's twisted social experiments). At various points in the past 200 years, a number of Vaults reopened and joined the wasteland community. A few Vaults are even still closed off, living in isolation for one reason or another and filled with vault-dwellers who know relatively nothing of the dangers of the wasteland world. In any case; populated, abandoned, or ruined, these Vaults represent a treasure trove for salvagers and wanderers alike."

With the widespread proliferation of atomic power, just about every community and every vehicle imaginable were powered by nuclear energy. With all those reactors came the nasty by-product of radioactive waste, which had to be stored somewhere (and not always where appropriate or safe location). Over the centuries, many of those storage facilities failed, leaking radiation into the surrounding area and compounding an already existing problem. Additionally, some creatures that survive in the Wasteland exude radiation, poisoning and weakening any other living thing that gets close to them.",

The difficulty of the check is determined by the severity of the source of Radiation (see Table 1.1: Radiation). If successful, the character reduces the Radiation Level increase by 1, and reduces it by a further 1 per additional {@symbols s}, to a minimum of 0. {@symbols hhh or d} on the roll can result in the character suffering from Radiation Poisoning; they add {@dice k} to every skill check until their Radiation Level is reduced to zero.

For the past two centuries, wastelanders have been using all sorts of materials to protect themselves. They will forge armor from whatever is lying around or scavenge suits from ruined police stations and abandoned military depots. The technique of making armor from animal hides and from forged metal has been rediscovered, and in some cases improved upon. Reliable suits can last for decades if cared for properly; some suits of armor have been handed down from generation to generation thanks to the rugged survivability of their construction."

                              "The major danger of taking chems is the likelihood of the user becoming addicted to them. Chem addiction is a widespread problem in many areas in the wasteland; seemingly everyone knows someone who's addicted to chems. Being a chem addict can cause social ostracization, but more importantly it creates a reliance on a drug that may eventually kill you. The best solution for dealing with addiction is to go through detoxification and hopefully break the addiction to the chem.",
                              "If someone is addicted to chems, they will need to undergo a detox in order to cure them of their addiction. There are two ways that someone can cure their chem addiction; medical detox or by going \"cold turkey\". It can be sometimes difficult to find a doctor who is able to perform a chem detox. These medical professionals are usually found only in the larger established communities, and rarely in smaller settlements or wandering the wasteland. This makes going cold turkey sometimes the only option to cure a chem addiction.",
