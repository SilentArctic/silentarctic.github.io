            "Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, is a warrior, shapeshifter, and trickster who stole immortality from the inhabitants of the Heavens (several times over), defied the Kings of Hell, and undertook a legendary journey to protect the monk Tang Sanzang from flesh-eating demons. Sun Wukong's arsenal of mythical artifacts is extensive, but his favored weapon is one as versatile as he is: the staff called Ruyi Jingu Bang. Given to him by the dragon-king Ao Kuang, this pillar of iron was used in ancient days as a measuring stick for the primordial sea. When he took possession of it, Sun Wukong found that it could be transformed in size, shrinking to fit behind his ear or stretching across vast distances, or even split into multiple copies of itself. Ruyi Jingu Bang recognizes a worthy user, emitting a glow when in the presence of such an individual; others cannot lift it, let alone wield it.",
            "When making a combat check using Ruyi Jingu Bang, your character may target any opponent within extreme range, increasing the difficulty of the check once for each range band beyond short range. As an action, your character may plant Ruyi Jingu in place and set its size at any silhouette from 0 to 6 and its encumbrance at any value from 1 to 1000, alter either of these values, or remove it."

The left side of the tree tends to focus on piloting ability and keeping a vehicle intact. The right side is more geared towards taking down enemy vehicles. The isolated middle section of the top two rows reflects that daredevil pilots tend to be dodgy, fast, and have good reflexes, even it doesn't directly help their piloting ability. Appropriately, there are three ranks of Daring Aviator. However, there is no straight line path from Row 1 to Row 5, so all talents on the fifth row ultimately cost a little bit more to achieve than they otherwise might. Dedication and Master are particularly difficult and expensive to purchase. This reflects that the character values risk above mastery and expertise, and has to dedicate themselves to achieve mastery."
