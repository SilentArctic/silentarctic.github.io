            "Giant spiders are a mainstay of the fantasy genre. As horrifying as any huge arachnid, bane spiders have the added ability to spit globs of acidic venom. This venom, which bane spiders can also inject with their fangs, conveniently allows them to start digesting their prey before even closing to striking range.",
            "Most bane spiders are roving hunters, but you might prefer one that shoots bundles of sticky webbing instead of (or in addition to) venom."

Just remember, character creation is your only chance to spend XP on characteristics (otherwise, to increase a characteristic you need to purchase the Dedication talent; see page 81).

The higher the rating, the hotter the fire or the more corrosive the atmosphere. See {@table I.6-8: Fire, Acid, and Corrosive Atmospheres} for some examples of different ratings.",
                        "Each round at the beginning of their turn, a character subjected to one of these hazards suffers wounds equal to its rating. This damage persists until they are no longer exposed to the hazard. With some corrosive atmospheres, the GM may decide they do not cause damage unless inhaled. In such cases, the character can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their Brawn before having to breathe and suffer damage.",
                        "It's primarily up to the GM to decide how long the damage from one of these sources lasts. Acids usually neutralize themselves after a certain period of time (as few as several rounds, or as long as several minutes or hours). Fires burn for as long as they have a fuel source, which again could be very briefly or for a very long time. A corrosive atmosphere, on the other hand, usually deals damage as long as the character is exposed to it.",
                        "{@b Putting out fire/neutralizing acid:} A victim might be able to stop the damage caused by fire by rolling around on the ground and making a {@skill Coordination} check. This is an {@difficulty Average} check on hard surfaces such as the deck of a spaceship, or an {@difficulty Easy} check on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. In the case of acid, it's up to the GM to determine if the same procedures negate the damage, or if the character must apply some neutralizing substance instead. The only way to stop taking damage from a corrosive atmosphere is to leave it."

Characters in these settings tend to have more \"realistic\" levels of ability. If you're running a low fantasy game, you may want to award XP at a slower rate."

                                    "Contemporary fantasy, sometimes known as urban fantasy, is perhaps the most different of all. Rather than a medieval-like world of limited technology or a purely fictional setting, contemporary fantasy takes place on Earth as we know it today—just with magic and monsters. Running a contemporary fantasy game requires the most deviation from the material presented in this chapter, although really, that just means taking the equipment and some other setting information from the {@setting modern day} setting, described on page 164 and mixing it up with the magic rules from page 210, along with monsters like those on page 146 and possibly the non-human fantasy species character options on page 142. Whether these fantasy peoples and magic users coexist openly with humans or dwell in a hidden realm of magic invisible to everyday folk is up to you."

                  "Fantasy Flight Games' own Runebound setting is a classic example of a high fantasy world. One reason it is a good setting for a wide number of board and miniatures games, from {@title Descent} to {@title Runebound} to {@title Runewars}, is because it includes many of the recognizable fantasy tropes, making it easily accessible to players. At the same time, it has a rich and deep lore that new games and expansions continually add to.",
                  "The Runebound setting is based on the world of Mennara, with most of the action set on the continent of Terrinoth. This region alone presents plenty of variety for adventures in terms of environments, cultures, and creatures. The civilized regions of the continent— and there is plenty of dangerous wilderness between— are primarily the domains of the Daqan Baronies and the Free Cities. The Aymhelin, the forested domain of the Latari Elves to the south, is a vast woodland, and the hidden city of Lithelin is a shining pinnacle of civilization hidden in the trees. Nevertheless, the forest is certainly no safe place for outsiders.",
                  "Threats of all kinds lurk in the darker places of Terrinoth, from the desolate and haunted Mistlands to the forgotten ruins scattered across the continent, some dating from before the First Darkness. To the east are the desolate and deadly plains of the Ru, but the evil of the Uthuk Y'llan has not been witnessed in centuries, and is surely nothing to worry about…",
                  "Yes, a great evil threatens Terrinoth, but the world of Runebound is not an overly dark setting. Beauty and wonder abound, and the alliances of humans, Elves, and Dwarves have vanquished evil in the past. Perhaps the defining event of Terrinoth's history was the creation of the Orb of the Sky following the First Darkness, that time when the three races united to repel and destroy the demon-tainted Uthuk Y'llan. This victory was only possible thanks to the unifying efforts of Timmorran Lokander, the greatest wizard to ever live. In creating the Orb, an object formed of pure magic, Timmorran hoped his gifts could outlive him and continue to serve the civilized peoples of Terrinoth.",
                  "Tragically, the legendary general and Timmorran's close friend Waiqar Sumarion attempted to seize the Orb for his own power. Before his death at Waiqar's hands, Timmorran shattered the Orb and ensured the thousands of resulting shards would be hidden across the land. Waiqar swore that he would gather the shards for himself, and he was granted undeath by dark forces in order to pursue his dark aims for eternity.",
                  "The shards—the Stars of Timmorran—contain incredible power, but only a mighty wizard could hope to harness it. When the dragonlords invaded Terrinoth during the Third Darkness, they gathered as many of the Stars of Timmorran as they could, and inscribed potent runes on the stones. The resulting runebound shards, which the dragons gifted to their mortal servants, lack the raw potential of the Stars, but they exhibit narrow magic effects that nearly anyone can employ.",
                  "Although the dragons are gone, the runebound shards remain scattered across Terrinoth. From his seat of power in the Mistlands, Waiqar the Undying commands his legions of undead in an endless effort to gather the stones and command the power Timmorran denied him over a millennium ago. Still, Waiqar is but one threat, the runebound shards only one source of power, and this story only one of many."

As is often the case when it comes to defining and categorizing fiction and its genres, opinions differ. But a strong argument can be made that the origins of steampunk lie in what are more commonly considered the earliest science fiction stories, period. The fantastic science and contraptions shown in the works of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and Mary Shelley are based in the technology of the 1800s but go far beyond what was actually possible at the time. This advance beyond historical realism is the core of steampunk."

And in many ways, that's a good representation of the genre. In steampunk, familiar, oldtime items, characters, and concepts get an anachronistic, industrial technology twist. Steampunk can encompass an aesthetic, a technology, a quasihistorical culture, and more. Steampunk settings range from nineteeth-century England with elements of fictitious technology to alternate presents and futures dominated by advanced retrofuturistic technology alongside delightfully antiquated customs.",

It's easy to customize your steampunk campaign by taking elements from the other settings presented in this book and adding your own rules where you like. For instance, if your steampunk world features clockwork technology alongside magic and mythical monsters, use the appropriate rules and character creation options from the {@setting fantasy} setting, on page 138.",

This, of course, primarily consists of steam-powered contraptions of all kinds; take away this focus on steam power, and you are simply no longer talking about steampunk. However, steampunk also frequently features impossibly sophisticated clockwork machines and outlandish experimentations in electricity—usually of the mad science variety. You might find clockwork robots, flying cars propelled by steam engines, and Tesla coils run amok.",

Technologies that failed or ran their course in reality might flourish, from dirigibles and ornithopters to difference engines and cogwork computers. The setting may be one with technologies that are simply ahead of their time compared to those of the real-life 1800s, an alternate present in which internal combustion engines never replaced steam power, or an entirely fictitious world where steam engines have reigned supreme for centuries.",
                        "Steam-powered machines may be clanking, hissing experiments liable to explode at the slightest provocation or reliable technologies that have functioned for years, and both extremes often exist alongside each other. It's an age of invention, regardless of what age (or universe) it happens to be! Generally, steampunk technologies are bigger, louder, and smokier than their modern digital equivalents, replete with gears, pipes, smokestacks, and brass tubing, but this isn't always the case. You might also have tiny mechanical insects operated by the most delicate clockwork mechanisms, or other such miniature marvels."

Steam turbines can generate electricity, an experimental battery might supply the initial jolt to a complex array of clockwork mechanisms, and so on.",

It is, however, generally a good idea to think about the primary motive force for a device and the end result, even if you have no idea of the interim steps. Your players should know that the flying machine they are embarking upon is steam powered, and that its insect-like wings keep it aloft, but there's no need to get into the details of how that all works. If you consider steampunk a subgenre of science fiction, it definitely veers toward the softer side. (See page 170 for more on this distinction.)",

This is a matter of taste and discretion, but it generally means keeping things from getting too close to the modern day real world. For instance, an electrically powered computer doesn't seem very steampunk, while a steam-powered difference engine is right at home. Likewise, electricity running to every home feels too modern and mundane, even though much more advanced applications, such as directed energy weapons, are perfectly appropriate."

                        "Hand in hand with improbable technology, a Victorian, or at least pseudo-Victorian, aesthetic marks out most steampunk works. Steampunk stories often take place in a fictionalized version of London or some other part of the British Empire during the nineteenth century (or perhaps a twentieth century dominated by steam power), but even those set in a different world entirely tend to feature a heavy, even embellished sense of Victorian style. This includes not only matters of dress and architecture, but decorum as well. Even should their adventures take them far from the heart of civilization, steampunk heroes are quite often high-society types with the freedom and resources to pursue a life of adventure.",
                        "It's worth noting that the social problems and exploitation of the 1800s may or may not be visible in steampunk. Some lighter steampunk adventures gloss over such issues, but darker tales might place a lot of emphasis on exploited workers and poverty, with heroes fighting to be more than just cogs in a machine (and putting the \"punk\" back in \"steampunk\").",
                        "However, steampunk stories and games don't have to closely resemble Victorian England. They might be set in the American Old West, with gunslingers, desperadoes, and railroad tycoons using (or working against) fantastical steam-powered machines well beyond the locomotives of history. However, even if your game takes place somewhere else on the globe or in a different world entirely, it's a good idea to still include some of the more recognizable fashions and mannerisms of Victorian British culture, since idealized or exaggerated versions of these are a major component of steampunk in the eyes of many."

                        "Steampunk takes all the promise of the Industrial Revolution and ensuing innovation and runs with it. In part, this is simply the catalyst for improbable technology (as we already discussed), but it's much more than that. Particularly significant advances in technology lead (both in reality and conceivably in most imaginary worlds) to all sorts of drastic social changes, and the more advanced the steampunk tech gets, the more potential there is for upheaval. Class distinctions and the way technology affects them could be a major element of a steampunk story or could fade into the background, and the same holds true for an RPG campaign.",
                        "Workers displaced by automated factories and other machines might take up adventuring, set out for the frontier, or turn to piracy to support themselves and their families. These same technological advances that reduce the need for human staff might also allow enterprising businesspeople to threaten the power of the traditional aristocracy. And all this is only dealing with realistic steam technology. Fleets of steam-powered airships could radically alter the way wars are fought, while coaches carried aloft by balloons might make flying cars a reality before (or instead of) automobiles. While steampunk is typically anchored in Victorian society, playing with the \"what-ifs\" of sophisticated steam technology can open up great possibilities for an exciting and unique campaign."

                        "Steampunk has been described as retrofuturism, and this holds true to an extent whether your steampunk game is set in an alternate past, an alternate present, or an alternate future. Heavily informed by popular conceptions of Victorian England and by definition heavily informed by the steam-powered technologies of the nineteenth century, steampunk pushes that technology forward, but along a much different path than taken in reality. The result is a world like Earth in the 1800s, but different, and possibly nearly unrecognizable except on certain fundamental details.",
                        "In a way, this trope highlights all the previous ones we've discussed. Steampunk fashion is like Victorian England's…but not; it's a thing all its own, with symbols of machinery (cogs, pipes, who-knows-what) embedded directly into clothing and accoutrements. Steampunk technology is like that of the 1800s, except it does things that are quite probably impossible for such power sources and materials. Society likewise resembles an outdated era, but with exaggerated versions of the things that interest us about that time, the exclusion of the more troubling parts, and the addition of whatever else just makes the setting feel right.",
                        "Steampunk can be the future viewed through the eyes of the past. Or it can be the past seen through a contemporary lens. You might put yourself in the shoes of someone living in the nineteenth century and imagine what the future might hold based on recent advances (looking at Victorian writers' and inventors' ideas that never worked in reality can be a good place to start), or you might take modern technology and work back, adapting it for a steam basis. Either way, steampunk is about keeping one eye on the past and one on possibility."

                  "The sun never sets on the Heliotrope Sovereignty, the vast empire stretching from the heart of longcivilized Margosa to the sands of Tortogos in the North and the ice wastes of the South. After a century of exploration, expansion, and conquest, the other nations on the continent have been brought to heel through diplomatic maneuverings, complex marriage arrangements, and the mighty airships of the Royal Navy. No suitable rival exists to challenge the majesty of Queen Vertiline and the House of Heliotropa.",
                  "Long the dynastic seat of the Heliotropans, the city of Steelhearthe has grown into a sprawling metropolis capable of administrating a continent-wide empire. Towering brick-and-iron buildings run for miles along the banks of the mighty Airis River, and sprawling factories stain the waters and fill the air with the brown smoke of burning coal. Each factory is surrounded by a belt of tenements full of the workers who keep the boilers lit and assembly lines running. The air of Steelhearthe is so fouled by industry that the Queen employs a small army of laborers to constantly clean and polish the crystalline walls of the towering Azurite Palace.",
                  "Here, within the indigo walls of the palace and the various manors and estates that ring the city, exist the rarefied heights of continental culture. Everyone, even foreign dignitaries and nobles, travels to Steelhearthe in the fall, when the southern winds blow away the worst of the smog. For months, they mingle, gossip, and scheme, striving to improve their stations and the fortunes of their families. Most young debutantes and beaux dream of marrying into the vast Heliotropan Dynasty. Not only does this offer wealth and prestige, but it also guarantees a job in the sprawling Imperial bureaucracy. (For this reason, the dynasty often arranges marriages based on ability, intellect, and drive.)",
                  "Outside the halls of power, the lower classes toil in Steelhearthe's factories or struggle for survival in its dark alleys and soot-stained tenements. The best that most of Steelhearthe population can hope for is a meager salary to pay for cheap bourbon and exorbitant rents. Revolutionary fervor flourishes in this climate. Even with the constant presence of the Royal Army and Imperial Inspectors, dozens of radicals plot to overthrow the Sovereignty from within.",
                  "A vast spiderweb of rail lines stretches out from Steelhearthe and links all of Margosa. The fruits of the Heliotrope Sovereignty's industries flow along these lines to every corner of the continent, ensuring the Empire's economic dominion. Many of the smaller countries grumble quietly that the railroad—along with the recently completed telegraph network—ensures military domination as well. Few wars or uprisings last long when the Queen's countless regiments of fusiliers and hussars are only days away by rail.",
                  "Those who chafe under Imperial hegemony look to the Tyrenia Colonies as the last refuge for freedom and independence. For centuries, the scalding waters of the Boiling Sea blocked all attempts at exploring the unknown West. However, during the great Age of Expansions, the invention of the rigid airship allowed Agatha Scarborough and her crew to breach the steam clouds. On the far side of the Boiling Sea, they found a boundless expanse of islands and archipelagoes—uninhabited, pristine, and full of valuable natural resources.",
                  "Scarborough's discovery set off a furious land rush. Though the Sovereignty claims nearly all of the Tyrenia Colonies in name, enforcing this edict proves difficult in practice. Tyrenia has become a haven of entrepreneurs, inventors, criminals, and revolutionaries. Anyone who loathes the stifling class restrictions of Steelhearthe and wants to build a new life for themself need merely find an uninhabited island and set up shop. Plenty of colonies have been founded on the ideals of liberty, socialism, and equality for all, and their inhabitants stand ready to defend those ideals to the death.",
                  "Of course, not all of those founding motives are so pure. Some of the sandy coves and green canopies of the farthest islands hide refuges of depravity and dark science. More than one former member of the Royal Society has fled to the Colonies after being expelled for unspeakable experiments. Alchemical elixirs able to transform humans into ravening beasts have begun making their way back across the Boiling Sea in recent years, causing chaos and mayhem on the streets of Margosa's cities. Even darker rumors have sprung up concerning long-lost family and friends shambling into a colonial town in some ghastly parody of unlife. Imperial Inspectors roam the Colonies searching for these mad scientists, and also to quash the stories claiming that a few aristocratic families have paid handsomely to resurrect a dear child or loved one. Some even claim that the Royal Society has established its own clandestine laboratory where it works to design a new clockwork soldier so it can fill the Queen's armies with metal automatons. More than one revolutionary group would pay dearly to find out if this is true.",
                  "The new charter corporations complicate matters further. Founded by royal decree, these organizations nevertheless have few aristocratic ties. The mercantile classes control the charter corporations, giving new luster to names like Sirius, Ward, Beryl, and Danburite in Steelhearthe's halls of power. These merchant families see great opportunities in exploiting the Colonies for their own profit. Already, Ward-Danburite colliers bring back tons of fuel to Steelhearthe's furnaces, and if you travel to the Colonies, you likely do it aboard a West Sirius airship.",
                  "Even those Colonies run by the Queen's agents or proper members of aristocratic households cannot be counted on for loyalty. Victor Caine—governor of Deckland, the largest and most \"civilized\" colony— may fly the Imperial flag over his estate. However, he happily takes money to let the Beryl family run its quartz mines how it pleases, and he dispatches Royal Hussars of his Argent Guard to break strikes at the galvanite refineries. On the other hand, Coveward Colony and the wayward Heliotropan scion Mackenzie Heliotrope-Augustus don't even pretend loyalty to the crown, and they have shot down at least one Navy airship to prove it.",
                  "These issues, plus the airship pirates, lost and abandoned colonies, secret military expeditions from rival nations, and the occasional armed rebellion, make the Colonies a patchwork web of conflicting interests. All too often, these conflicts boil over into raids, plots, and outright war."

The following section presents a few common tropes found throughout weird war settings. As with everything else in this book, the following list should not be considered definitive.

                        "The most common and defining trope used in weird war settings is alternate history. Alternate history takes real-world historical people and events and tweaks them, just a little bit, to make them more fantastic than fact. Playing fast and loose with history can be exceedingly fun and rewarding and is an interesting exercise in \"What if?\" What if humans had developed space travel in the late nineteenth century? What if Mesoamerican cultures had killed Cortez and driven the Spaniards back across the sea, then followed with their own invasion force? What if an alien spacecraft had been dug up by Napoleon's army in 1800 beneath the Great Sphinx? What if the Nazis actually had succeeded with all of their bizarre occult nonsense? How would any of these events have reshaped history? Ask yourself questions like these when designing your weird war setting and see where they take you.",
                        "Once you have your alternate history all laid out, you may wish to take a hard look at it to see what you can eliminate from actual history to make your setting more fun to play in. It's a sad fact that much of history is ugly and complicated, a far cry from the sanitized stories and heroic myths that most people know. As you create your own setting, you may want to excise some of those ugly and complicated elements in order to create a more entertaining world to go adventuring in. At the very least, you should check with your group to see what level of historical realism they are comfortable with.",
                        "Take, for example, Fantasy Flight's Tannhäuser setting which takes the \"cool\" parts of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century history and adds in a liberal dose of the occult, myth, mad science, and conspiracy theories. In Tannhäuser, a secret society of German nobles and powerful occultists raised a long-dead German hero to lead their country to greatness. This ancient and powerfully evil leader united Germany, consolidated power, and declared himself Kaiser of a new Reich. Then, of course, this new Kaiser set out to conquer the world.",
                        "The Reich in Tannhäuser is very loosely based on the Nazis' Third Reich, but only loosely. Hitler was never born, the Nazis never rose to power, and the real horror of concentration camps and war crimes has been replaced by werewolves and demon soldiers. An undying, all-powerful, 400-year-old Kaiser wields ultimate power in Germany, backed by the toadying quislings of the nobility. These changes remove much of the real-world ugliness and tragedy of history, and it makes the bad guys the Kaiser and the nobles. The average German is a pawn in their malicious games, not another Nazi. This allows players to enjoy a more storybook-like version of history, where good and evil are clearly defined, and heroes wear bomber jackets and punch out demons."

Mad science, as it pertains to weird war settings, is largely focused on weapons of war, especially superweapons and doomsday devices, and these devices often take the place of nuclear weapons.",

Two spies chasing one another along construction gantries hundreds of feet in the air? Cool. Blasting a bad guy through a sheetrock wall with a shotgun? Cool. Escaping in a stylish European sports car that turns into a submarine? Very cool.

The Rule of Cool doesn't give you a free pass to run roughshod over game realism and suspension of disbelief. It's supposed to be a way of spicing up a setting and incorporating exciting and explosive scenes with a healthy serving of movie logic.

If suddenly your hard-bitten, high-speed/ low-drag modern warfare characters are jumped by a pack of zombies without your having stated at the beginning that \"Hey, there will be some supernatural elements in this game,\" your players are going to object, no matter how cool you think zombies are."

These come in two forms: clones and bioroids (humanoid robots). An invention known as braintaping allows these androids to be given human thoughts and personalities. Crucially, however, they're still owned by the corporations that created them. Earth, Luna, and Mars teeter on the edge of a revolution as androids increasingly dominate the workforce and leave millions of humans jobless. At the same time, people are starting to wrestle with the question, \"Just how human are these androids, and should they be treated as property at all?\""

Space opera, at least originally, was defined by what it's not—hard science fiction. Although the term was initially meant as a disparaging label, fans and creators have embraced it in the decades since it first came into use.",

There's no reason you can't incorporate some scientific rigor into your space opera setting, despite the term's origins. For it to truly feel like space opera, though, the focus should be on your characters and the adventure, not the science behind your setting's advanced technologies."

In some cases, characters might travel from one end of the galaxy to the other in a relatively short time. Space opera settings are huge not only in a physical sense, but often in a historical sense as well. Space operas often include civilizations that have been around for centuries or millennia",
                        "Even space opera stories with a limited scope are likely to feature high stakes, at least relative to the scale. A setting that encompasses a galaxy might see the heroes facing threats to that entire galaxy, whether we're talking complete destruction or merely utter subjugation by an evil regime. Not all space opera settings or stories are so big, though. What matters is that the risks and dangers facing your characters make for high drama and excitement. It's perfectly possible to have a space opera campaign, if not an entire setting, take place within a single solar system. Just make sure that you scale the stakes appropriately: if the setting is a star system, then the stakes can be the fate of that star system. Always think big."

Characters likely use exciting but implausible weapons, such as laser pistols that fire visible and explosive beams, energy swords that can cut through anything, and rifles that disintegrate targets. Flying cars, force fields, tractor beams, invisibility devices, planet-destroying weapons, and other such marvels are introduced because they are cool and help the story, not because they are a logical extrapolation of current scientific developments.",

It's necessary in order to tell the sweeping, galaxy-spanning stories space opera is known for, but any explanation of its function tends to be cursory and certainly can't hold up to any sort of scrutiny. It may rely on fantastical assumptions such as a parallel universe or a miraculous—yet readily available—fuel source. The speed of interstellar travel varies between settings, and may have some basis in the explanation behind the technology. Ultimately, however, travel in space operas tends to be as fast or slow as the story needs for the best dramatic effect. You might explain it as gravity fluctuations, particle storms, or some inherent unpredictability of the technology, but don't worry about defining the travel time between various planets in your setting (unless you really want to)."

While humans likely show much of the diversity they do in reality, alien races tend to abide by cultural and personality traits across their entire home planet and beyond, with the potential for rare exceptions. Even humans are likely bound by planetary or galaxy-wide governments and cultures, in stark contrast to the fractious civilization of present-day Earth.

These entities usually have very human personalities, and language barriers are rarely an issue unless they serve an important part of the plot. Depending on the setting, these various beings might be insular and live apart, or commingle across the galaxy. Regardless, they are certain to interact at some level, and interspecies diplomacy might be a large part of the story.",

In reality, extraterrestrial life—should it exist at all—is pretty unlikely to resemble humanity. In space opera, however, not only do aliens frequently look and act like us, but they even emulate distinctly recognizable human cultures. This approach may require some suspension of disbelief, but it avoids many of the obstacles that can arise from a more realistic treatment. It also ensures that non-human characters are relatable not only to the audience (or players, in the case of an RPG), but to the humans—and other aliens—within the setting. From a roleplaying game standpoint, it's fun to have the option to play an alien, and keeping them very human-like makes it easier to get in character.",

Whether it takes place in the future or another galaxy altogether, a space opera setting might feature elements that would be right at home in a Western, medieval fantasy adventure, detective story, or just about anything else. A space opera setting could include dutybound, star-faring knights or desperadoes with hightech revolvers. Characters might wield advanced melee weapons, even though the guns are equally advanced and feature all the advantages guns always do in a knife fight. Depending on the setting, plausible explanations might be provided for such anachronisms, or they might simply come down to the Rule of Cool.

But this is no dawning age of peace and cooperation. Even as a score of stellar nations retake their seats on the Council, these great races scheme against each other and skirmish along interstellar borders and on unclaimed worlds.

Yet the greatest persisting damage wasn't inflicted by Sol dreadnoughts, but by the Lazax councilor who set afire the Hall of Cartography before fleeing with the handful of Lazax who heeded his warning of the threat facing the Empire. Due to the destruction of those records and the ensuing decline, no reliable maps of the galaxy exist today. Despite countless thousands of years of exploration and colonization, in many ways it is as if the great races were stepping out among the stars for the first time.",

Humans may live throughout the galaxy, but those of the Federation of Sol have a unique sense of purpose, seeing it as their destiny to rule the stars.",

This continued contact has put them in an advantageous position to call upon alliances, to say nothing of the information they have collected in the intervening centuries. As a faction and a people, the Hacan prefer diplomacy and commerce over war and bloodshed, but they are more than ready to fight to protect their interests.",

            "However, some creatures and individuals can fly, but not at the same speeds as vehicles. In these cases, the creatures or individuals simply move from one place to the other by flying, but still use the rules presented in this chapter for situations such as combat. Their flight is handled mostly narratively, with a commonsense approach. For example, a flying creature could easily fly over difficult or impassable terrain, or fly over water without having to swim. It could cover vertical distances in the same way that individuals cover horizontal ones. However, there are some points to keep in mind concerning flying creatures.",
            "Creatures and species that can hover rely on swiftly moving wings, bags of lighter-than-air gas, or other systems to move while staying above the ground. This type of movement follows the same game rules as those for other creatures, with the following exceptions: hovering creatures ignore difficult or impassable terrain as long as they can reasonably stay above it, and they ignore the penalties for moving through water. They generally have to stay relatively close to the ground (within medium range) unless noted otherwise.",
            "Creatures that can fly (such as most birds) use aerodynamic principles such as lift to stay aloft. These follow all the same rules concerning terrain as creatures that hover. However, they have to maintain at least some speed to stay aloft, and thus while flying must spend one maneuver every turn to move (they can actually change position, or just circle or wheel in place and effectively remain where they are). Most flying creatures can move faster than hovering or ground creatures, and they can move from long range to short range using a single maneuver."

Two of the PCs move toward one group of guards, getting within short range, and the other group moves to the opposite set of guards.
