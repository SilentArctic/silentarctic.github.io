Many nightclubs and other high-end social spaces employ luxury-model Adonis or Eve units to “entertain” their customers, while in seedier areas of New Angeles, pleasure bioroids sate humanity's basest instincts."

It has integrated 360-degree radar, infrared, and low-light sensors that constantly monitor the battlefield, and it has a variety of integrated threat-response options. Overpowered servos allow units to carry the heaviest anti-personnel and anti-armor weaponry, often Gauss rifles, missile launchers, or heavy machine guns.",

Many middle managers worship upper management and executives with an almost religious reverence in their struggle to get ahead, which sometimes makes them oblivious to simple realities obvious to those underneath them. Thus, their personal attention on an underling's project can often be as hurtful as it is helpful."

            "While there is no official proof that hellions exist, they are an open secret among some circles of Netcriminals. No one is certain if these small, cat-shaped robotic constructs are drones. However, some {@i disenfrancistos} have claimed to see hellions chasing hyperrats or spending hours batting at holographic signs, which suggests an autonomous (and animalistic) operating system. Other criminals have come back to supposedly safe crash pads to find their gear and possessions shredded, chewed on, and thoroughly trashed, and spotted a catlike creature with glowing red eyes ducking out a window or ventilation shaft. An unlucky few have even been found dead and savagely mauled in similar crash pads."

            "Originally designed in the Jinteki concepting labs as a practical joke, the tiny giraffes (and the joke) got out of hand one evening and started wandering the halls of the research facility. Before the staff could round up their wayward animals, one stumbled into the division manager—and her five-year-old daughter. Immediately, the daughter had a new pet and the nervous jokers had a promotion, and six months later, Miranda Rhapsody had an adorable teacup giraffe gifted to her in a purse. Then everyone had six-figure bonuses."

Herds of peccaries wander the less-developed (or more-abandoned) portions of New Angeles, living on a hearty diet of trash, plant matter, and discarded fast food. Most people dismiss the comical-looking animals as harmless, but in truth, herds can contain dozens of the beasts, and they've entirely lost their fear of humans. If enough peccaries mob someone, their tusks can do some serious damage."

            "Bioroids are fully artificial creations, with all the attendant benefits and disadvantages. Their strength and durability are second to none, and bioroids also don't sleep, eat, or breathe, allowing them to go places and undertake tasks normal humans and even clones cannot. On the other hand, bioroids are not viewed as people, but rather property. Likewise, bioroids find it difficult to become accepted in some places, their artificial appearance conjuring fear or hatred in certain groups.",
            "All bioroids follow directives, such as not to harm humans and not to allow humans to be harmed through their inaction, that are hardwired into them during their creation. Rumors persist, however, of bioroids that have somehow broken their programming or evolved beyond it. If you play a bioroid, you need to decide whether they are still beholden to their directives. It could be that some incident caused them to become more aware of their sentience and now they rationalize their actions in an almost human way. Alternatively, a bioroid can be factory fresh and need to navigate the tricky moral world of obeying their owner's commands while also following their hardwired directives."

            "Being a machine has many advantages, from strength and endurance to being able to survive in space and underwater. Bioroids are stronger than most other archetypes and cannot die in the same way a human or a clone does. The downside is that they are beholden to their programming, and while they are able to learn on their own, they filter their experiences from the perspective of a created being.",
            "In New Angeles, bioroids are a commodity, and that's how your character will be viewed by the general population. Many people see bioroids as \"things,\" or sometimes \"things that stole my job.\" Thus, many people see little difference between mistreating or damaging a bioroid and damaging a hopper. This viewpoint isn't universal, but it is widespread. What's more, a bioroid doesn't have any of the rights people take for granted. An emancipated bioroid either pretends to belong to an owner, or lives in the undercity where they can stay out of the public eye.",

If you choose to play a clone, you should decide how restricted your character is by their neural conditioning, and to what extent it guides their actions. On the surface, it might make them peaceable and compliant, not unlike a naive child when faced with conflict, while underneath they might struggle with strange and dark emotions. Some clones may have even broken free of their conditioning, learning through their acts that certain things they thought impossible are completely within their power; such characters can either be wondrous souls discovering the world or dangerous beings without a shred of empathy."

This makes clones amazing at their chosen profession; they were literally made for it.",

Clones are owned, and they are treated the same way people would treat an appliance or pet. However, clones have one advantage other androids do not; because a clone is still genetically human, emancipated clones can pass as people. These clones tend to prefer garish or flashy clothing, bold haircuts, and tattoos and piercings: anything to make them look as unlike their thousands of siblings as possible.

            "The first cyborgs appeared in the late twentieth century, as artificial hearts and electronic, motorized prosthetic limbs began to restore and repair damaged human bodies. However these protocybernetics served only medical functions, replacing their damaged or missing organic counterparts. All this started to change decades ago, when companies began to develop cybernetics that could enhance, not just restore, a body's functionality. Just as these technologies were starting to appear, the Lunar Insurrection began.",
            "Many of the people we think of today as cyborgs were soldiers. Lured by the promise of higher pay and free augmentations, many enlistees volunteered for cybernetic \"upgrades\" that made them more lethal warriors. When the War ended and these specialized combatants mustered out, many found themselves unable to fit into the peacetime world. Many took on jobs as corporate security, joined prisec outfits, or even fell in with orgcrime.",
            "Since the War, the popularity of cybernetic enhancements has spiked. The new generation of implants can improve an individual mentally as well as physically, and plenty of people are willing to spend some credits and go under the knife to become \"better\" than what they were."

            "Cyborgs are strong, tough, and generally dangerous, even if they aren't necessarily very social. If you play a cyborg, your character's cybernetics may color people's perceptions of them; many people assume a cyborg is a war veteran or a violent individual. Seeing noticeable cybernetics can be off-putting for some. However, that stigma is fading fast in New Angeles. If you like the idea of playing a veteran soldier, a mercenary warrior, or someone who wants to be more machine than human, a cyborg is the right choice for you."

            "If cyborgs are a melding of person and machine, then g-mods are the complete changing of that person into something new. While some individuals may have their genes subtly altered, g-mods modify their DNA in profound and radical ways, changing their appearance, their intellect, and sometimes the core functions of their bodies. To date, g-modding is the closest humankind has come to true transhumanism, with some arguing that the most modified g-mods are no longer entirely Homo sapiens.",

Other g-mods adopt cosmetic changes like blue skin or cat irises, feathers, fangs, claws, or prehensile tails.

G-mods are also among the smartest of all the archetypes, intelligence being commonly boosted by in utero modifications.",

Those g-mods who prefer subtle enhancements tend to come across as \"better\" people, and most love and envy them in equal measure. However, the more \"improved\" a person is, the more they can inspire a sense of unease in others. Further, the \"wylders,\" who go for animalistic, outlandish, or shocking g-mods tend to be treated with fear and revulsion. If you like the idea of playing an intelligent and charismatic charmer, a super-strong bodybuilder, or an undercity punk with wolf eyes and fangs, a g-mod is the right choice for you."

            "Those born on the Moon consider themselves a people apart—and why not? They are, after all, members of the first generations that have grown up free from the loving embrace of planet Earth. More than just having a natural affinity for low gravity, slightly longer limbs, and less muscle and bone density, Loonies are different because they no longer see Earth as home. This has fostered a fierce independent streak in most Loonies, many of whom see themselves as a minority in the thrall of Earth-bound megacorps or far-off governments. A particular sticking point is that Heinlein, the largest settlement on Luna, is simply the twelfth district of New Angeles, a city almost four hundred thousand kilometers away. It is sentiments like this that sparked the Worlds War, and though Earth might consider it part of the past, many Loonies have long memories.",
            "Growing up on the Moon teaches Loonies self-reliance in a way no place on Earth could. When you can't even take the air you breathe or the shielding that protects you from lethal radiation for granted, you learn pretty quickly to be aware of everything in the environment around you. Almost every Loonie has a tale about a time when the scrubbers went out in their dome or when they were doing a Luna walk, their suit tore, and they had to stumble home watching the O2 meter tick down."

While they may not be as strong or tough as other characters, they have excellent coordination and reflexes, and they are just as smart and personable as anyone else.",
            "In New Angeles, Loonies are survivalists and outsiders. They are just strange enough that they will probably never fully fit in anywhere outside the domes and tunnels of Heinlein and the rest of Luna. In the megalopolis, they often lend their talents to those who are outlawed or in subcultures on the fringe of society, because chances are those subcultures have found a haven somewhere on the Moon. If you want to play an incredibly agile pilot, a revolutionary hell-bent on freeing their home from imperialist oppression, or a grizzled spacer at home above Earth's atmosphere, a Loonie is the right choice for you."

While bioroids and clones work in all levels of industry, the first generations of people born on other worlds have grown up and had kids of their own, and though science allows people to rebuild their bodies as they see fit, \"naturals\" still make up the vast majority of humanity. At their core, naturals resemble their ancestors going back a few thousand years, even if they do carry a PAD, have a fit-chip implant, or sport a biolumin tattoo. The wealthiest naturals may benefit from some minor genetic modifications that weed out hereditary diseases, but most naturals have the same genetic baseline template as their grandparents and great-grandparents.",

Naturals hail from every nation and locale on Earth, from the cosmopolitan streets of Kampala and the inland wilds of Australia to the low-income housing projects of Esmeraldas and the undercity alleys of Base de Cayambe in New Angeles. Naturals are part of every creed, country, and ethnicity on Earth, and just about any natural may have come seeking their fortune on the streets of New Angeles."

            "In a megalopolis of half a billion people or more, Bounty Hunters excel in finding the ones that don't want to be found. Trained in various forms of conflict resolution, a Bounty Hunter seldom lets anyone stand in their way once they have taken a job, and if it means getting their mark, they are not above making a mess or breaking the occasional law. Bounty Hunters differ from more subtle kinds of investigators or agents in that they often expect trouble, and their training reflects this. They tend to pack more firepower and armor than other characters, and they usually stem from a more combat-oriented background.",
            "While most Bounty Hunters are heavy-handed street soldiers with a knack for finding people, they can vary considerably depending on where they come from and who they work for. Some are ex-cops; bound by a sense of honor and a respect for the law, they know just how hard the NAPD has it and try to work with them as much as possible. Others are on an orgcrime payroll, private contractors only in name who take their orders from the shadows and think little of looking the other way. Then there are the true free agents, the ones in it for the creds, the thrill, or the fame.",

Investigation is as much art as it is science, and good Investigators learn to rely upon their gut, knowing when to squeeze someone for information and when finding the truth requires a light touch. Of course, following a trail through the neon wilderness of New Angeles takes more than a keen mind; Investigators are also adept at bending or breaking the rules when they need to and, when all else fails, know how to handle themselves in a fight.",

Most Investigators fall somewhere between these two extremes. An Investigator can be a police detective, a corporate troubleshooter, a municipal inspector, a reporter, or an employee of a foundation dedicated to transparency in government and corporate affairs, to name a few options.",

            "The offspring of corporate CEOs and their vast families, Risties are the new royalty. Ristie characters can be entitled dilettantes or driven heirs to the corporate crown, both often very well connected. Whether or not they care about the multibillion-credit corps, hedge funds, and investment banks that support them, Risties live a life few New Angelinos can dream of: sleeping in sprawling arcology penthouses, taking regular trips to the Castle and its nightclubs, having a view from the top, and looking down through the tinted windows of their private hoppers. Even without the creds, simply being a Ristie is a ticket into some of the most exclusive places on Earth and beyond; few bouncers or prisec operatives are willing to strong-arm someone who might be Jack Weyland's third cousin twice removed.",
            "Fame and fortune come at a price for the Ristie, however. The same face that can open doors is also hard to forget or ignore. Also, being a member of a corporate dynasty means responsibilities, some of which can come at inopportune moments or put a Ristie at odds with their friends. Of course, not all Risties are so privileged. A Ristie might instead be in exile, fallen from grace, and either be working against their family or trying to win their way back into their good graces. Or they might simply be trying to keep their very famous face out of the feedchannels.",

There are also free companies that operate under license in legally ambiguous areas, like Luna, Mars, or parts of the Ecuadorian state; these mercenaries promise both firepower and discretion. Some Soldiers sell their skills far more cheaply, having done their time or choosing to eschew authority.

The two most common assault rifle calibers are 5mm and 7mm, rounds descended from the old 5.56 and 7.62 rounds respectively.",

Around since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the nickname refers to any firearm that has the action and clip behind the trigger, which allows for an easier to handle weapon. Although the first bullpup weapons tended to have some balance (and therefore accuracy) issues, modern smart systems eliminate this problem, letting wielders take full advantage of a shorter gun that's easy to swing around. Shorter ranged by nature, bullpup carbines tend to be used in enclosed spaces, and by criminals and security officers who like being able to hide an assault weapon in a briefcase.",

            "Plasma cutters are powerful cutting tools designed for use in shipbuilding, spacecraft manufacturing, heavy fabrication, and other industrial applications. Powered by a lightweight electrical generator, these tools create a high-intensity electrical arc that makes thermal plasma by reacting with a stream of pressurized carrier gas (generally argon). The powerful plasma jet can cut or weld almost any metal or alloy, making it both versatile and indispensable.",

A standard unit consists of a power pack, a cutting head, an array of tips for different jobs, and a reinforced power cable. Like the HHI Neptune waterknife, many of these tools were repurposed by Lunar and Martian rebels into deadly melee weapons and used in ship boarding, hand-to-hand fighting, and for carving up bioroids.",

Without the proper current frequency, would-be criminals must resort to white-hot plasma cutters or high explosives, which don't leave much hope of looting the contents inside.",

Still, in Shadow of the Beanstalk (just like in real life), people can get irritated about always being asked to pay back every cup of coffee or ride to the office. If a favor seems especially minor, your GM can add {@dice setback} to any checks made to exchange the favor and can also add {@dice setback} to subsequent skill checks your character makes when dealing with that individual."

Barriers keep unauthorized users out, sentries collect data on users and watch for any who might not be authorized to be in the system, and code gates differentiate between authorized and unauthorized connections (and boot those unauthorized connections from the system).",

Almost all ice has negative consequences for failing to break it, and most of the time a runner can't avoid it by backing out at the last moment.

            "Heavy freighters primarily transport cargo and people between the Earth and Mars, but a number of freighters also make the Earth-Moon run. Unlike the famous Challenger Memorial Ferry slow-boats that use orbital momentum to make the trip to Heinlein in weeks, these freighters use onboard fusion reactors to power ion drives that allow them to make the crossing in a matter of days."

Some are fitted as \"spaxies\" to get people from Midway station to the adjacent orbital facilities, while others are set up with multiple heavy arms and remote-operated tools to serve as construction boats. All are blunt-shaped, no-frills affairs with low-power ion engines that run off solar panels and rechargeable capacitors."

            "So far, only one aerospace fighter type is actively deployed in orbit (the United States SXF Striker), but it's no secret that the US and every other major power on Earth is working on their own space-based fighter craft. Unlike military dropships, space superiority fighters can't enter the atmosphere. They're distinctly not aerodynamic; usually some variation on a ball with engines on one end and weapons on the other. Massive gyros allow a fighter to literally spin in place, meaning that while they don't look it, they're some of the most maneuverable ships in space."
