It could be that some incident caused them to become more aware of their sentience and now they rationalize their actions in an almost human way.

An emancipated bioroid either pretends to belong to an owner, or lives in the undercity where they can stay out of the public eye.",

On the surface, it might make them peaceable and compliant, not unlike a naive child when faced with conflict, while underneath they might struggle with strange and dark emotions.

Just as these technologies were starting to appear, the Lunar Insurrection began.",

While they may not be as strong or tough as other characters, they have excellent coordination and reflexes, and they are just as smart and personable as anyone else.",
            "In New Angeles, Loonies are survivalists and outsiders. They are just strange enough that they will probably never fully fit in anywhere outside the domes and tunnels of Heinlein and the rest of Luna. In the megalopolis, they often lend their talents to those who are outlawed or in subcultures on the fringe of society, because chances are those subcultures have found a haven somewhere on the Moon. If you want to play an incredibly agile pilot, a revolutionary hell-bent on freeing their home from imperialist oppression, or a grizzled spacer at home above Earth's atmosphere, a Loonie is the right choice for you."

            "Most humans in New Angeles are pretty normal—at least from a biological point of view. While bioroids and clones work in all levels of industry, the first generations of people born on other worlds have grown up and had kids of their own, and though science allows people to rebuild their bodies as they see fit, \"naturals\" still make up the vast majority of humanity. At their core, naturals resemble their ancestors going back a few thousand years, even if they do carry a PAD, have a fit-chip implant, or sport a biolumin tattoo. The wealthiest naturals may benefit from some minor genetic modifications that weed out hereditary diseases, but most naturals have the same genetic baseline template as their grandparents and great-grandparents.",
            "Of course, despite these commonalities, most naturals vary wildly from one another. Naturals hail from every nation and locale on Earth, from the cosmopolitan streets of Kampala and the inland wilds of Australia to the low-income housing projects of Esmeraldas and the undercity alleys of Base de Cayambe in New Angeles. Naturals are part of every creed, country, and ethnicity on Earth, and just about any natural may have come seeking their fortune on the streets of New Angeles."

Naturals also start with more skills and experience than other archetypes, meaning that they give you the most flexibility and customization options when building your character.",

In every respect, they are the \"average person\" of the setting, who can get along with almost everyone and be accepted in most places without a second glance. If you like the idea of playing an ordinary person who has to rise to extraordinary heights over the course of a game, a natural is the right choice for you."

Couriers are these skilled individuals. They live by their reputation and possess a host of skills for dealing with whatever might stand in their way. A good Courier is a born survivalist, equally able to fight, talk, or run their way out of most situations. Sometimes, this might mean getting a hard copy of a sensitive data download down a hundred floors of the Talamire Arcology before local security realizes it's been stolen; at other times, it might mean a run from Broadcast Square all the way to the Root.",

These Couriers get repeat business because they prove not only that they're good at the job, but also that they are trustworthy and discreet. Some Couriers are bonded corporate servants working for Haas-Bioroid, NBN, or the like and may even be specially programmed bioroids or conditioned clones. Others are independents who live and die by their rep, never looking at the cargo they transport, only promising to get it there on time.",

In worlds where people will go to great lengths to hide their crimes from the countless electronic eyes that watch society, sometimes only a person's instincts can pick up the trail. Investigation is as much art as it is science, and good Investigators learn to rely upon their gut, knowing when to squeeze someone for information and when finding the truth requires a light touch. Of course, following a trail through the neon wilderness of New Angeles takes more than a keen mind; Investigators are also adept at bending or breaking the rules when they need to and, when all else fails, know how to handle themselves in a fight.",

Some Investigators work for corps, backed by big money and big resources, while others keep a hole-in-the-wall office below the plaza level and take whatever jobs will pay the rent for one more month. Most Investigators fall somewhere between these two extremes. An Investigator can be a police detective, a corporate troubleshooter, a municipal inspector, a reporter, or an employee of a foundation dedicated to transparency in government and corporate affairs, to name a few options.",

Even without the creds, simply being a Ristie is a ticket into some of the most exclusive places on Earth and beyond; few bouncers or prisec operatives are willing to strong-arm someone who might be Jack Weyland's third cousin twice removed.",

Of course, not all Risties are so privileged. A Ristie might instead be in exile, fallen from grace, and either be working against their family or trying to win their way back into their good graces.

            "Although assault rifles remain the go-to infantry weapon for most militaries, many PMCs and corporate security outfits prefer to use the more compact and accurate \"bullpup\" weapons. Around since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the nickname refers to any firearm that has the action and clip behind the trigger, which allows for an easier to handle weapon. Although the first bullpup weapons tended to have some balance (and therefore accuracy) issues, modern smart systems eliminate this problem, letting wielders take full advantage of a shorter gun that's easy to swing around. Shorter ranged by nature, bullpup carbines tend to be used in enclosed spaces, and by criminals and security officers who like being able to hide an assault weapon in a briefcase.",

A typical combat shotgun is a light, short-barreled, magazine-fed weapon used by government and prisec forces. Primarily chambered in 12- and 20-gauge, combat shotguns are select-fire weapons that can fire a single round, fire a three-shot burst, or empty an entire magazine with a pull of the trigger. A combat shotgun's major drawbacks are their savage kick and their nasty tendency to jam during automatic fire. The kick is easily contained by integrated smart recoil dampers, but even modern weapon development hasn't solved the jamming issue.",

Masers can be tuned to excite water molecules in their targets; this can't hurt targets in metallic armor but is utterly lethal to everyone else. Originally used for long-range, high-output communications and specialized industrial uses (such as \"baking\" lunar rocks to vaporize and release water molecules trapped inside), many were converted into weapons during the Lunar Insurrection. Most domes and fortified bunkers were constructed of a combination of composites and pressed lunar rock, both of which allow focused microwaves to pass right through.",

Instead of a sharp blade or a jet of superheated plasma, waterknives use a high-pressure stream of abrasive blasting media suspended in a viscous liquid. The liquid lubricates and cools the materials being cut, and the blasting medium— typically subminiature quartz pellets or powdered synthetic diamond—does the actual cutting.",

            "Wired skulljacks, models that require a physical cable connection to a computer or system, are older technology and usually found among people who can't afford wireless ones, those who consider the \"retro\" style of a cable connection cool, and eccentrics who believe the physical connection gives them a stronger, faster, and more reliable connection. Wireless skulljacks are more common, are less invasive than wired skulljacks, and take up less space in an individual's head; however, despite claims to the contrary by industry flacks and security \"experts,\" wireless skulljack signals can sometimes be suppressed or intercepted.",
            "A skulljack is not a computer, but may be connected to any computer (and is essentially a BMI that is surgically installed into your character's brain). It provides all of the benefits of a BMI; during a Network encounter, a runner can choose to \"go deep\" as an maneuver. Until they \"go shallow\" as a maneuver, they may only interact with the Network (performing Network maneuvers and Network actions); they cannot interact with the regular world (such as by performing regular maneuvers or actions). However, they may perform a second maneuver each turn during Network encounters without spending strain.",
            "In addition, whenever your character's skulljack is linked to a computer, your character increases their ranks in all Knowledge skills by 1. Characters with a skulljack decrease their strain threshold by 1."

However, occasionally a proper pilot gets their hands on a sports hopper, at which point they appreciate these vehicle's mechanical advantages."
