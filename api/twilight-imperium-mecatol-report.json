This allows them to roll up into a ball while they sink into a particularly deep torpor. Eremes can remain comatose for months at a time, barely even breathing, until their acute senses of smell and heat register a nearby food source. Then they explode into a frenzy of action; exhausting their caloric reserves to consume whatever may be in range; plant, animal, or sapient being."

Somehow, the species managed to survive the fall of Mecatol Rex, though at a steep cost.",

Their beaks are thinner and needle-pointed, and the skin on their legs and feet has thickened tremendously. Gangliapodes live primarily around patches of {@sidebar caliga mold}, where their tough legs allow them to stalk through the slime mold without being dissolved or devoured. They pick through the patches for dead and dying creatures and plants to eat. In doing so, they ingest plenty of toxins. Those are channeled to barbs that have evolved on the spurs of their legs, so the gangliapode has a lethal poisoned attack."

            "Nobody knows what the primals are. In fact, nobody knows if they really exist, or if they are a bedtime fable created to frighten children. The legend of the primals goes back to the earliest days of the Lazax occupation of Mecatol Rex; stories of large, pale, bipedal creatures with two pairs of arms that haunted the lowest levels of the subterranean vaults beneath Mecatol City. Some said they could blend into walls or heal grievous wounds in moments. Any inhabitant of Mecatol City could claim to know a friend of an acquaintance of a relative who had seen a primal, or knew of an imperial experiment to create, tame, or communicate with the things. Regions beneath the city were said to be their domain; the Catacombs of the Primal and Pale Hand Chasm were particularly famous.",
            "In the millennia since the fall of the Lazax Empire, the tales have only grown. Some say the primals didn't exist before, but do now; monstrous devolved descendants of the ancient Lazax blindly hunting for any species responsible for their people's downfall. Others say they are the original inhabitants of Mecatol Rex, long before it became first an ecumenopolis and then a wasteland. Some even say that the primals are twisted genetic experiments left over from when the gene-sorcerers ruled Mecatol Rex, just waiting for their masters to return.",
            "{@b GM's Note:} The profile given here is strictly mechanical and does not exclude any of the potential theories as to the Primals' origins. You get to decide what exactly the Primals are if you want to include them in your campaign."

Ruvar birds were small, weighing less than half a kilogram, and able to fit comfortably into the literal and metaphorical cracks of the city.",

Today's ruvar birds are much leaner and more skittish than their ancestors, and much more aggressively omnivorous. Small f locks of the birds roam Mecatol City, roosting on buildings and swarming over fruiting clid trees, garbage piles, and un attended meals. The ones that live on the outskirts of the city or in the Sea of Desolation are more vicious, and tales abound of unwary persons set upon and stripped down to bones by a ravenous flock."

Destroyed during the Sol bombing at the onset of the Twilight Wars, the Imperial Intelligence HQ building was never rebuilt by the Winnaran Custodians (probably because they had no need for facilities built to house a galaxy-spanning spy agency). Instead, the ruins were left as they were. The only thing the Winnarans did was confirm that the sublevel bunkers and basement facilities were not breached by the bombing, then seal them up to ensure that none of Imperial Intelligence's dirty secrets would ever see the light of day.",

                  "The Council's new agency would need facilities to operate from, and the Winnarans offered them the land that once held the Imperial Intelligence headquarters. The Custodians claimed it was a symbol of restoration, with the new intelligence apparatus inheriting the mantel of the old. The first Tribunii noted sourly that the ruins were also the least valuable and desirable land in Mecatol City.",
                  "The Custodians dedicated funding and work crews to clean up the old ruins and build a brand-new headquarters building on the land. Both were hilariously unequal to the task, with current estimates placing the completion date sometime in the next four decades. But in the meantime, the Keleres unsealed the old sublevel complex and moved into the underground facilities. And for the last five years, they've been making them selves at home.",
                  "However, the Keleres have expanded some areas and sealed up others to try and adapt the space to their needs.",
                  "The facilities can be divided into six main sections. Beyond these lie the abandoned sublevels that the Keleres have kept sealed off and unoccupied. And beyond that? Any records were lost long ago, but Mecatol Rex's depths are a warren honeycombed with forgotten sewers, transitways, underground arcologies, and natural caverns.

It's actually part of the reinforced foundation of the old Imperial Intelligence building, which is the reason the sublevels survived the Sol bombing so long ago.

The storage rooms hold supplies brought into the facility from Mecatol City, while the security checkpoints ensure no unauthorized personnel enter the facility proper. The control center is the largest room surrounding Receiving, with large windows overlooking the whole circular space.

The largest set is reserved for oxy/nitrogen breathers and has multiple 12-person bunk rooms, lockers, cleaning/hygiene facilities, and a communal mess and kitchen. The next largest has replaced the bunk rooms and cleaning facilities with spaces f looded with fresh and salt water.

The first is a barracks with a cooled ammonia atmosphere that is currently uninhabited, while the second is a hyper-hot barracks space specifically developed for the Gashlai and isolated from the rest of the facility. It even includes heat-locks where the Gashlai can don their Ember Suits before leaving. The final set of living facilities have been gauss-shielded and filled with an energized plasma that mimics the natural environment of the Creuss. However, this was created before the Creuss informed their colleagues that they have no problem remaining in their suits indefinitely. Creuss members still use the barracks spaces, but infrequently.",
                              "Most of the rank-and-file Keleres agents stay in these barracks spaces, while senior agents and support staff have smaller personal quarters on the lower levels. There is no requirement that an agent live within the headquarters, but given the prices of housing in Mecatol City and the modest living stipends provided to Keleres personnel, the cramped communal barracks often seem preferable to a tenement in the Keldive Slums or Cratered Quarter. Those who can afford to live in one of Mecatol City's nicer neighborhoods are either independently wealthy or making money through other, more...questionable means. In either case, they often think twice before advertising their status.",
                              "The final noteworthy facility on Red Level is the {@b Situation Briefing Room}. This large, semi-circular chamber is dominated by a U-shaped conference table wrapping around holo-projectors, with additional vid-screens located along the walls capable of showing everything from a masterful illusion of being in a mountaintop meeting space or underwater tropical utopia to the status of military forces across the Gul system. This space is reserved for meetings between Tribunii, members of the Galactic Council, senior agents, and high-level Winnaran Custodian liaisons. Regular field agents almost never enter it."

Each of the {@b Tribunii offices} is a multi-room affair with an antechamber, main office, private refresher facility, and genelocked micro-vault. The Tribunii are also able to get their offices decorated to their tastes. Kuuasi Aun Jalatai's space is deliberately minimalist, with furniture constructed from the wood of zero-gee trees and an inconspicuous cabinet to store his decanter of firespice liqueur. However, the walls are covered with holoscreens of the highest quality, which Kuuasi uses to project views of his home in the Atharal Gas Torus. Harka Leeds, on the other hand, outfitted her office with a battered duranium desk and captain's chair from the old flagship of the Leeds and Victoria Corp. The walls are dotted with shelves covered with masterful models of famous ships from the Mentak Navy. Finally, Odlynn Myrr's office has been completely paneled in Q'waar wood and the walls lined with jungle plants.

Signs of decay and ill-repair such as cracked walls, moldy panels, and broken light fixtures become more and more common. In some places, the hallways are choked with rubble. In others, they are completely impassable.",
                              "This level is colloquially known as the Vaults. It began as a place for Imperial Intelligence to store all sorts of dirty little secrets accrued after thousands of years of operations. After the bombing, much of it was either sealed behind collapsed passageways or simply forgotten. The Vaults are so deep that they have been built beneath Mecatol Rex's water table, and even as the surface was reduced to a dust-lashed desert some of the vault passages began to slowly flood.",
                              "When the Custodians began to renovate the Vault levels, they found a maze of cold, dark water, half-collapsed passages, and locked vaults containing who knew what. For the most part, the Custodians and later the Keleres left those vaults sealed up and forgotten. But in a few cases, the Keleres have reactivated some of the vaults to use for their own purposes.",
                              "The {@b electronic archives} are the most important of these renovated spaces. Within several interconnected storerooms the Keleres have constructed a secure data archive. There are no connections to the rest of the facility; even power is provided by a miniature entropic field tap donated by the Naaz-Rokha Alliance. This means the Keleres archives cannot be hacked or altered by any outside agency, and the Tribunii and Custodian liaisons take the archives' physical security very seriously as well. However, it also means that anyone who wants to access these records must walk all the way to the archives to do so.",
                              "Near the electronic archives are the Keleres' {@b physical archives}. Originally, these were simply unused and dry storage rooms that the first agents began cramming with physical records; plas-sheet printouts, non-alterable data crystals, and even the occasional books gathered in the field. In the last year, however, Tribunii Myrr has begun to push for the Keleres to make physical backups of all the organization's important records; especially mission after-action reports. These are all micro-etched into sheets of thin-pressed duranium and stored in massive binders.",
                              "Since this archiving program began, Myrr has restricted access to the physical archives to a handful of senior agents and a single Winnaran Custodian, Tsoi Iq Matriona. Dour and completely lacking a sense of humor, Tsoi is responsible for transcribing and binding the records. Most Keleres realize that the physical archives give them the chance to access information without using their login credentials in the electronic archives. So Tsoi has had to turn away dozens of would-be fact-finders. However, it's rumored that she has a particular love for Lokian salt-shrimp, a delicacy that is incredibly difficult to get on Mecatol Rex. Whether she'd compromise her ethics for a sublime gastronomical experience is an open question.",
                              "And beyond the Keleres' archives are the rest of the vaults: kilometers of flooded spaces, collapsed passageways, and storage rooms that haven't been opened in millennia. The Keleres have no idea what sits in most of the vaults, and no particular enthusiasm for conducting an assessment. After all, who knows what horrors Imperial Intelligence locked away, just waiting to be unearthed?",
                              "And lurking secrets of past civilizations are just one of the many dangers facing would-be explorers. Beyond the risk of drowning or being crushed in a surprise cave-in, those exploring the vaults also run the risk of encountering some of Mecatol Rex's remaining wildlife."

Behind a mag-locked entryway on the research and engineering levels, a heavy lift platform descends over fifty meters to a badly maintained substation. From here, Custodian teams have cleared an ancient access passageway, laying down ferroplate planking and hanging up strings of long-lasting lights. The passageway ends in a series of disused storage vaults whose walls have partially collapsed, revealing natural and artificial caverns beyond. From here, brave souls can enter the unexplored regions where the Intelligence HQ ends and the rest of Mecatol Rex's undercity begins."

Here the buildings were protected by defense grids or antiship batteries, and thus the catacombs beneath them remained largely intact. In the thousands of years since, life has infiltrated these sub terranean spaces from the Sea of Desolation and Mecatol City, blending into a unique amalgamation. This is the one place on Mecatol Rex where relatively clean water isn't scarce, as the water table has dropped and the rock above filters out most surface pollutants. Food—either detritus from Mecatol City above or the odd surface dweller who stumbles into this underground world—is more common than in the Sea of Desolation as well. Finally, with no sapient beings to threaten them, the animal life is more aggressive and vicious. Those who descend into the catacombs had better watch their backs and travel armed.",
