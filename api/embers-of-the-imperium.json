Some believe so strongly they are willing to sacrifice themselves for their brethren."

The Rokha, on the other hand, are black-furred felids who are very distant genetic relatives of the {@archetype Hacan}, though the two species diverged long ago.

Courtship rituals are almost always group affairs. Bonded pairs live and often work together, and even share many of the same interests, so it's rare to see one and not the other."

The first are the Winnaran Custodians, citizens of Mecatol Rex and guardians of the throneworld until the day when a new emperor arises. The second are the Winnu of their ancestral homeworld. The Winnaran Custodians tend to be a studious, dutiful lot, with a dour demeanor bred from millennia of caring for a shattered world. Their Winnu cousins could not be more different.",
            "All Winnu are a bipedal humanoid species with hairless, green skin that denotes a very distant reptilian ancestry. Biologically they don't have any particularly distinguishing characteristics; they're omnivorous and warm-blooded, and have adapted to a range of climates. Socially, however, both Winnu cultures tend to be very strong-willed. Whether this a coincidence or evidence of some deep-seated genetic trait is up for debate. But even as the Winnu of their homeworld insist on their right to rule and call their cousins weak and submissive, they forget that the Winnaran Custodians have preserved the shattered throneworld of Mecatol Rex for over three millennia, and thus far have not relinquished it to any claimant."

Few are more dedicated to the organization than those who have done this. If you want to play a passionate diplomat, a righteous military officer, or a careful and considered scholar, then a Winnu is right for you."

However, while some Winnu of their homeworld still use this convention, most now have personal names, then a second name that is a slight variation of the first (usually the last syllable is modified). This second approach has become even more common since the Winnaran Custodians refused to grant the Winnu the Imperial Throne, as more Winnu seek to distance themselves from their Winnaran cousins.",

Officially, cohort leaders are appointed by senior members of the Keleres, or sometimes by the Tribunii themselves. However, like so many Keleres officials, cohort leaders are often chosen on an ad hoc basis. Some teams elect their own, or perhaps a well-liked Captain decides to put their own cohort together. Regardless, Captains tend to wield significant authority and autonomy, but these are almost entirely dependent on the support of their cohort.",
            "Of course, many Captains were military officers before they were transferred to the Keleres. In fact, a number were officers aboard naval vessels or even commanded starships of their own. Former military officers tend to fall into two groups: junior officers sent by their faction because they were considered \"expendable,\" and senior commanders whose actions so offended or disgraced their service or a superior officer that they were exiled to the Keleres as punishment.",
            "There are also a few Captains who learned their skills in civilian life. Captaining a freighter or courier vessel still requires a flair for command and a penchant for quick and decisive action, both of which serve a Keleres Captain well. Civilians are less likely to end up in the Keleres, but some of the Great Civilizations do pay their citizens to join or sponsor them rather than sending valuable military personnel. Some civilians even volunteer, either because they believe in the duties of the Keleres or because, through bad luck or their own incompetence, they have nowhere else to go.",

They might sneak inside places, avoiding sensors and sentries alike to gain access to a facility or eavesdrop on a conversation thought private. Alternatively, infiltrators might forge documents or wear a disguise to trick their target into opening secure areas for them. Most infiltrators specialize in one approach or the other, but the best can employ whichever technique best fits the situation. They sometimes even pose as diplomatic aides or security attachés to conceal their intentions and identity, even from their own teammates. Of course, gaining access is merely a means to an end—an end that might include assassination, intelligence or data collection, target extraction, or sabotage.",

Either way, an infiltrator's best weapon is secrecy—if caught, most get ruthlessly interrogated for however long they can justify being left alive.",

Most have years of experience in a government agency, such as the corrupt magistrates of Sol; the Winnu Inspectors with their endless red tape; or even the Yin Inquisition, known for its moral absolutism. While some investigators might be assigned to the Keleres as a form of exile, others might be there to dig up information about their rivals or might even have requested the posting for personal reasons.",
            "Investigators are generally clever and meticulous, and have a gift for sorting fact from fiction to discern the truth of a situation. However, they tend to view most social interactions as battles for the concealment or extraction of information, and they lean heavily on the power of whatever authority they can derive from their official station. Some investigators' lack of social graces combined with the nature of their work tends to land them in trouble with powerful and dangerous individuals, and as such, most aren't strangers to attempts on their lives and high-speed chases.",
            "Investigators often take the lead on Keleres missions related to performing inspections or investigating accusations of wrongdoing. They wield what power the Keleres has to conduct interviews and to visit sites to collect evidence of any activity that might violate treaties or pose a threat. Such activity might include covert military actions that defy international law, political assassinations, illegal weapons research, and more. If enough evidence is turned over to the Tribunii, formal censures or trials might occur, and the investigator might be called to testify or present evidence.",

However, those sitting across the table from a Keleres Liaison should not mistake their desire to talk for weakness: they are tireless in pursuit of their goals.

Other Shepherds might work for celebrities, managing crowd control and fending off obsessed fans. Shepherds who serve as witness protection program officers keep high-risk individuals alive as they wait to testify. Many Shepherds have military backgrounds and may have escorted VIPs through war zones or served as marines protecting cargo freighters from Mentak raiders or pirates.",
            "On the surface, Shepherds appear calm, but in reality they operate in a state of near-constant high stress. Their day is spent imagining worst-case scenarios, identifying and mitigating risk, and studying local threats. This gives many a reputation as a boring stick-in-the-mud. However, most have experience operating with social elites and long ago learned to remain professional and polite when dealing with clients and their social circles, so they usually can avoid being too much of a killjoy until there is an imminent threat.",

The opportunities for high-paying jobs are constant. Of course, keeping watch over a team of Keleres agents is challenging on its own, with multiple threat vectors on every assignment, often in less-than-friendly locations.

            "Trail Stalkers come from all sorts of backgrounds, including work as wilderness survival experts, military snipers, hunters, and even outdoor recreation prefessionals. Some might have expertise in specific environments like rainforests or deserts. Others might have more obscure expertise, like mountain survival, asteroid cavern exploration, or low-gravity moon bounding. Most have a background in general wilderness survival regardless of their specific expertise, so no matter what wild environment they find themselves in, they can find food and shelter and avoid dangerous flora and fauna.",
            "Trail Stalkers typically operate alone or in teams of two, and they often possess few social graces. Many are quiet and unsettled around others or in crowded urban environments, unsure how to converse. Of course, some have no problem trying and talk incessantly, unaware of social cues that suggest they might be bothering someone. They thrive outdoors, under a large sky where they can feel connected to nature with starlight on their face. Trail Stalkers can almost seem like different people once they are in their element.",
            "The Keleres use Trail Stalkers to scout places suspected of illegal activity—such as unauthorized excavation of Mahact archaeological sites or use of treaty-violating military encampments—and to monitor the activity of threats like the L1Z1X. Trail Stalkers also deploy to track down wanted individuals hiding in wilderness areas and to provide fire support or counter-sniper support to teams engaged in high-risk negotiations. In addition, they sometimes accompany research teams in the field, where they can act as a guide and provide some sense of security.",

The bow itself is a simple but durable weapon that may be made from any number of common and durable alloys. What is truly unique about the weapon is the arrows it fires. Each is crafted from a strand of pure bellidrium that has been molecularly bonded together. The bellidrium reacts in such a way as to create a virtually unbreakable shaft with a nearly frictionless surface tapering down to a molecularly sharp needle point. Only at the rear of the arrow, where the bonding process is interrupted to allow for the connection of stabilizing fins, can the arrow be grasped without slipping from one's fingers. The arrow can penetrate most forms of body armor with relatively minor force (although the narrow profile means it does surprisingly little damage when it hits).",

            "As unique as the symbiotic nature of the {@archetype Naaz-Rokha}, the fighter known as the Eidolon is a variable-geometry mech that can transform from a bipedal walker into a heavy starfighter. The starfighter mode has a delta-shaped profile with large dual thrusters along the sides of the craft; in the sleek cockpit, the two pilots sit in parallel alongside the Eidolon's main weapon: a mag-powered single-barreled assault cannon. Twin seeker missile tubes under the wings complete its fighter-killing armament.",
            "When it deploys into its bipedal form, the mech stands with a vaguely feline shape and posture. In the walker mode, the bonded pair of pilots are seated with the Rokha in the main cockpit in the torso and the Naaz operating a smaller cockpit in the head. Two arms unfold to carry the assault cannon as if it were an infantry rifle. The missile tubes cannot fire in this configuration, but in exchange, magnetic field projectors generate a blade of contained plasma along each forearm. With these plasma reapers, the Eidolon can carve up enemy mechs and vehicles many times its size."

            "Interceptors are small, single-seat attack craft that are integral to any empire's starfighter corps. They pave the way for heavier starfighter attacks, intercept intruders, and screen larger starships from enemy fighters and bombers. Interceptors are built for unmatched speed in order to perform their role, and they rely on it as their primary form of defense. If they are not able to eliminate their opposition quickly, they may succumb to a well-placed or lucky shot. Interceptors are too small to mount FTL drives and require a {@vehicle carrier} for interstellar transport.",

Heavy baffles hide the ships' thruster emissions, and internal heat sinks let them hold onto waste heat until it can be discharged where it won't be noticed. Finally, the most recent versions of these vessels have sophisticated light/wave deflectors that render them invisible to the naked eye, though this system is very power intensive.",

            "Pirate attacks are a constant threat throughout the galaxy. They prey upon any starship they consider worth the risk to attack. Most pirates operate from raiders: fast, armed, FTL-capable transports that carry a significant amount of cargo. Pirate raiders are built for quick strikes and quicker escapes. In a stand-up fight against a similarly sized warship, they would be outgunned.",
            "Common pirate tactics are to attack from ambush, either by hiding inside a nearby nebula or debris field or by simply running dark and silent until they're within striking distance of their target. If victims are lucky, the pirates may only disable their ship and haul off any commodities. If they're unlucky, the pirates may destroy their quarry after looting it for everything that isn't welded down."

            "Destroyers are a collective term for fast, maneuverable, FTLcapable escort warships. They are bigger than corvettes but smaller than cruisers, usually with a length or width of one to two hundred meters. Traditionally they serve as escorts or picket line defenders, shielding vulnerable ships from enemy flankers.",
            "Typically, destroyers perform two roles: harassing larger warships with torpedoes and seeing off starfighters with their considerable antifighter weaponry. Destroyers can be overwhelmed by large swarms of starfighters, but they are likely to eliminate many of them in the process. However, most destroyers stand little chance by themselves against cruisers or larger warships. Generally, this means the only times destroyers operate independently of larger warships is on scouting missions or when escorting convoys, where their armament is sufficient to deal with most pirates.",

The major powers of the galaxy maintain their fleets of dreadnoughts to intimidate and deter their foes. Ironically, this, plus their extensive cost, means most navies tend to carefully husband these vessels, keeping them in \"home\" or \"reserve\" fleets unless fullfledged war breaks out and leaving cruisers and destroyers to do most of the real work of maintaining an interstellar empire.",

They carry the heaviest of the capital-grade weapons, which includes basically any guns lethal enough to crack the hulls of other battle line warships (or any smaller ships that stray into range). Dreadnoughts protect this with the thickest armor and most powerful shields a ship can carry, and they also carry a squadron or two of starfighters and some missile batteries for antifighter and ground bombardment work.",
