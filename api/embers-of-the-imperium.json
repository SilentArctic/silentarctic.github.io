            "\"Assault cannon\" is a colloquial term for any number of weapons designed to rapidly fire a barrage of heavy projectiles at a target. Some have multiple rotating barrels to increase firing speed, while others simply rely on rapidly cycling mechanisms or pulsing electromagnetic coils. Military forces deploy assault cannons in areas of high-density troop movement to protect vulnerable forward command posts and extraction points overwhelmed by enemy forces. Many starships carry much larger versions of assault cannons for space combat.",

            "The Shikrai needle bow is an ancient yet deadly weapon used by skilled {@archetype Shikrai} hunters. The bow itself is a simple but durable weapon that may be made from any number of common and durable alloys. What is truly unique about the weapon is the arrows it fires. Each is crafted from a strand of pure bellidrium that has been molecularly bonded together. The bellidrium reacts in such a way as to create a virtually unbreakable shaft with a nearly frictionless surface tapering down to a molecularly sharp needle point. Only at the rear of the arrow, where the bonding process is interrupted to allow for the connection of stabilizing fins, can the arrow be grasped without slipping from one's fingers. The arrow can penetrate most forms of body armor with relatively minor force (although the narrow profile means it does surprisingly little damage when it hits).",
            "The bow and its arrows have no mechanisms of any kind, which makes them completely undetectable by all modern scanning devices. The shots are also completely silent, which may allow your character to make ranged combat checks while remaining hidden at your GM's discretion.",

Most are bipedal or quadrupedal, but some have dozens of legs, while a few utilize other means of locomotion, such as grav-pods or tracks. High-speed light mechs serve as scouts, flankers, and pursuers. Lightly armed and armored, they are still able to bring notable firepower to different points on a battle line at a moment's notice.",

            "As unique as the symbiotic nature of the {@archetype Naaz-Rokha}, the fighter known as the Eidolon is a variable-geometry mech that can transform from a bipedal walker into a heavy starfighter. The starfighter mode has a delta-shaped profile with large dual thrusters along the sides of the craft; in the sleek cockpit, the two pilots sit in parallel alongside the Eidolon's main weapon: a mag-powered single-barreled assault cannon. Twin seeker missile tubes under the wings complete its fighter-killing armament.",
            "When it deploys into its bipedal form, the mech stands with a vaguely feline shape and posture. In the walker mode, the bonded pair of pilots are seated with the Rokha in the main cockpit in the torso and the Naaz operating a smaller cockpit in the head. Two arms unfold to carry the assault cannon as if it were an infantry rifle. The missile tubes cannot fire in this configuration, but in exchange, magnetic field projectors generate a blade of contained plasma along each forearm. With these plasma reapers, the Eidolon can carve up enemy mechs and vehicles many times its size."

They pave the way for heavier starfighter attacks, intercept intruders, and screen larger starships from enemy fighters and bombers. Interceptors are built for unmatched speed in order to perform their role, and they rely on it as their primary form of defense. If they are not able to eliminate their opposition quickly, they may succumb to a well-placed or lucky shot. Interceptors are too small to mount FTL drives and require a carrier for interstellar transport.",

            "Even after tens of thousands of years, there remain large expanses of unexplored space in the galaxy. Long-range scout ships are built for endurance to reach remote corners of the galaxy. They are equipped with comforts similarly sized ships are not, since the crew regularly contends with isolation for weeks or months.",
            "Scout ships tend to be as bulky as medium-sized interstellar freighters. They pack that space with rugged FTL drives and significant fuel stores, ample cargo space for supplies, and some minor defensive armaments. Their sensor systems are top notch, allowing scout ships to conduct thorough planetary and system scans. Many scout ships carry a ground vehicle large enough to transport the entire crew if necessary.",
            "Keleres teams are commonly issued long-range scout ships for their assignments. As long-range, FTL-capable craft with adequate cargo space and the ability to transport cargo or a light vehicle, scout ships fulfill many of their needs. Keleres who expect trouble may \"up-gun\" their scout ship, sacrificing some cargo or crew space to pack more arms and armor onto their craft."

Heavy baffles hide the ships' thruster emissions, and internal heat sinks let them hold onto waste heat until it can be discharged where it won't be noticed. Finally, the most recent versions of these vessels have sophisticated light/wave deflectors that render them invisible to the naked eye, though this system is very power intensive.",

            "Pirate attacks are a constant threat throughout the galaxy. They prey upon any starship they consider worth the risk to attack. Most pirates operate from raiders: fast, armed, FTL-capable transports that carry a significant amount of cargo. Pirate raiders are built for quick strikes and quicker escapes. In a stand-up fight against a similarly sized warship, they would be outgunned.",
            "Common pirate tactics are to attack from ambush, either by hiding inside a nearby nebula or debris field or by simply running dark and silent until they're within striking distance of their target. If victims are lucky, the pirates may only disable their ship and haul off any commodities. If they're unlucky, the pirates may destroy their quarry after looting it for everything that isn't welded down."

However, most destroyers stand little chance by themselves against cruisers or larger warships. Generally, this means the only times destroyers operate independently of larger warships is on scouting missions or when escorting convoys, where their armament is sufficient to deal with most pirates.",

            "Destroyers are a collective term for fast, maneuverable, FTLcapable escort warships. They are bigger than corvettes but smaller than cruisers, usually with a length or width of one to two hundred meters. Traditionally they serve as escorts or picket line defenders, shielding vulnerable ships from enemy flankers.",
            "Typically, destroyers perform two roles: harassing larger warships with torpedoes and seeing off starfighters with their considerable antifighter weaponry. Destroyers can be overwhelmed by large swarms of starfighters, but they are likely to eliminate many of them in the process. However, most destroyers stand little chance by themselves against cruisers or larger warships. Generally, this means the only times destroyers operate independently of larger warships is on scouting missions or when escorting convoys, where their armament is sufficient to deal with most pirates.",

            "Dreadnoughts are the core of any major battlefleet. Huge, dangerous, and ruinously expensive to build and operate, these are prestige ships for most of the Great Civilizations. The major powers of the galaxy maintain their fleets of dreadnoughts to intimidate and deter their foes. Ironically, this, plus their extensive cost, means most navies tend to carefully husband these vessels, keeping them in \"home\" or \"reserve\" fleets unless fullfledged war breaks out and leaving cruisers and destroyers to do most of the real work of maintaining an interstellar empire.",
            "All dreadnoughts are built around powerful weapons. They carry the heaviest of the capital-grade weapons, which includes basically any guns lethal enough to crack the hulls of other battle line warships (or any smaller ships that stray into range). Dreadnoughts protect this with the thickest armor and most powerful shields a ship can carry, and they also carry a squadron or two of starfighters and some missile batteries for antifighter and ground bombardment work.",

Battle lines of dreadnoughts tend to be unwieldy, clumsy formations, their only saving grace being the sheer bloody power at their disposal.",

            "Dreadnoughts are the core of any major battlefleet. Huge, dangerous, and ruinously expensive to build and operate, these are prestige ships for most of the Great Civilizations. The major powers of the galaxy maintain their fleets of dreadnoughts to intimidate and deter their foes. Ironically, this, plus their extensive cost, means most navies tend to carefully husband these vessels, keeping them in \"home\" or \"reserve\" fleets unless fullfledged war breaks out and leaving cruisers and destroyers to do most of the real work of maintaining an interstellar empire.",
            "All dreadnoughts are built around powerful weapons. They carry the heaviest of the capital-grade weapons, which includes basically any guns lethal enough to crack the hulls of other battle line warships (or any smaller ships that stray into range). Dreadnoughts protect this with the thickest armor and most powerful shields a ship can carry, and they also carry a squadron or two of starfighters and some missile batteries for antifighter and ground bombardment work.",
            "However, all the firepower, armor, and defensive systems come at a price. Dreadnoughts are slow, relatively, and do not have the sheer range or stamina of a cruiser. Battle lines of dreadnoughts tend to be unwieldy, clumsy formations, their only saving grace being the sheer bloody power at their disposal.",
