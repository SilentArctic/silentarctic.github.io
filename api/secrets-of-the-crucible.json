            "Shadows seems to know every secret in the Crucible, and there's no Shadows agent more infamous or more cunning than the Svarr elf called Dodger. Appearing when and where he's least wanted, Dodger seems to always be there when choice whispers are spoken, the greatest mysteries are about to be buried, and an adversary's deepest weakness is laid bare. He's also not above wetwork if the price is right, especially if his guild is the one asking.",
            "Dodger always seems to be on the job, but he certainly enjoys his downtime when he can take it. Though he can afford better, he can often be found at the worst dive bars of the Lawless Zone, where he can really relax. Such is his reputation that work tends to come to him, enough to keep him comfortable and allow him to aid his guild more than most. Dodger has often been seen working with the Archon known as Censorius. He doesn't speak of the jobs he undertakes for her, but lately he's been buying more rounds than usual at the Broken Spire."

Although she operates out of her small treehouse office in Cobweb Grove, many beings brave the wilderness and unpredictable movement of the Lesser Uncanny Forest to procure her services. As a relatively small being, she excels at jobs that require stealth. It is her ability to perceive things that others do not that has brought her to the attention of several Archons.",

Although everyone knows she does some artful massaging of the text, each story displays with reasonable veracity yet another mysterious slice of life on the Crucible. Everyone also knows she has plenty more hidden away, ready to be released if she comes to harm, which means she has plenty of beings ready to come to her defense if needed."

Seeing noticeable cybernetics can be off-putting for some. However, that stigma is fading fast in New Angeles.

            "Giants are massive, exceptionally powerful beings, many of whom reach three meters in height. Their nature is as extreme as their forms; giants are as quick to boom out a laugh as they are to launch themselves into a frothing rage. Giants are incredibly social creatures, although this social nature tends to manifest as some combination of constant jeers, threats, and deafening roars. Whether to bully or simply to have someone bear witness to their superiority, they feel the need to have others around them, and they usually become sullen and despondent when left alone too long. A lone giant, as the saying goes, is a lonely giant.",
            "Because they might otherwise all too frequently kill one another attempting to establish clear leaders, they often use the appearance of strength rather than physical confrontation to establish dominance. This leads giants to pursue acquisition of the largest weapons, the armor with the most spikes, the fiercest mechanical augmentics, or enough scars to look as though they must have already died and ascended to Vanhalla, all to lessen the frequency of lethal challenges. After all, if a giant weren't tough enough to keep such gear, a stronger giant would've come along and taken it.",
            "Giants usually wear what they want. This is mostly a mix of armor slabs, huge spikes, and crude yet powerful cybernetics, They also favor tattoos along with face and body paint to honor their forebears, hopefully assume the power of various beasts, or promote their favorite bands. They are rarely found without weapons, usually huge axes or hammers amplified with energy blasters, jet engines, explosives, or other subtle refinements.",
            "For a giant, subtlety might mean skipping the tenth round of Æmbrew before setting themself on fire with screaming fireworks and charging into a platoon of martians. Or deciding against strapping the eleventh robotic skull on their favorite rocket axe, because \"maybe it's too clanky.\" Or sounding a savage, Crucibleshattering roar of joy each and every time they belch."

These unpretentious beings are happiest when they are part of a roaring fight or an even louder festival, or when carousing after a roaring fight at a loud festival. That doesn't mean they don't appreciate sciences or the arts—just that the nature of their appreciation usually involves high explosives and volcanic eruptions. If you find the idea of playing a towering pillar of strength who lives for extremes and to always challenge themselves against others to be appealing, a giant is the species for you."

            "Like elves, goblins are generally diminutive and quick. The similarity, however, essentially ends there. Goblins are almost universally tough and hardy; in their own way, they are more akin to the exceptionally loud and violent giants than to the subtle elves.",
            "Most goblins have blue- or purple-hued skin stretched taut over an angular face and long, sinewy arms. The wild and flowing tufts of brightly colored hair on their extremities give them the appearance of having just received large electrical shocks. Their appearance fits well with their unruly social behavior and wildly antagonistic approaches to many situations— approaches they often employ just to see what will happen. When a spark is needed to launch a conflict, goblins are quick to provide the Æmber and flint. Fortunately, their resilient nature helps them survive when things go bad.",
            "Goblins are quite competitive and are among the most prominent gamblers on the Crucible. They are very adaptable too—a trait that has become an essential aspect of many Crucible cultures. Adept engineers, they especially delight in constructing explosives of all types. Unfortunately, most also disdain test protocols, blueprints, and trial runs. Instead, they tend toward a \"Let's try it and find out!\" method of invention.",
            "Surprisingly, their creations and upgrades actually work slightly more often than they explode. Perhaps also surprisingly, given how easily goblins are dismissed by other species due to their diminutive size, an unusual number of goblins serve as respected shamans and other leadership positions. Many beings tend to underestimate them, and so goblins tend to surprise friends and foes alike with unexpected expertise."

One has to be, after all, when flying an untested Æmber-powered jetpack past the redline or corralling a herd of angry grumpus. Many goblins are drawn toward roles as valued engineers or religious leaders, but they can be found in almost any function. If you like the idea of playing a character who's willing to take risks and push the boundaries, then a goblin is for you."

While they are mostly humanoid in shape, krxix have a large head featuring compound eyes and twin antennae. They have two sets of arms, each arm ending in three clawed fingers, and they have a colorful, segmented exoskeleton. Their appearance is initially unsettling even to the extremely cosmopolitan inhabitants of Hub City, but krxix are naturally so overwhelmingly friendly that most beings soon forget their looks and buy them a bowl of bubbling sucrale.",

Their lifespans are relatively short, which they never realized until they met other species on the Crucible. While this was unpleasant to learn, their relocation opened up their species to a wider range of experiences. Many krxix have leapt at the opportunity to discover as much as they can about this artificial world.",

They are also always ready to share with others, as that is almost ingrained in their genetic material due to their having evolved in crowded hive environments.

Despite this, a few beings believe the original phyll all arrived on the Crucible at the same time, their different forms emerging over time through natural evolution—though using the word \"natural\" on a constructed world is likely suspect. Some of the more common types of phyll have evolved a single reddish sensory organ to emulate vision. Many also carry tanks of Æmber-infused liquids to ensure they have sources of vital nutrients, and even decorate these containers as a sign of status.",

They can feel deep in their roots that something is not right, a feeling that most have learned to ignore but is always present. Phyll who try to explain this feeling to other species eventually give up, finding no suitable common experience to equate it to. Despite this, phyll tend to get along quite well with other species on the Crucible as they rarely compete for the same resources and often have outlooks the other wouldn't consider.",

            "In a world filled with bizarre sentients, spirits certainly stand out. Unlike organic or even inorganic beings, spirits have no physical body. Each is made of energy of an unknown type and often appear as luminous forms.",
            "Stories of spirits' origins vary as much as the colors they can manifest (many of which flow into spectra not visible without expensive equipment). The spirits of Sanctum, for example, say that they came to be at the very moment of their glorious Enlightenment. Each Sanctum spirit arises, they claim, from an act of extreme selflessness or righteousness—an act so noble that it makes the being transcend physical form and burst forth with eternal light. Other beings who could also be classified as spirits maintain they are artificial constructs who always existed on the Crucible. Other spirits state they are simply another species brought to this world long ago and who wander the impossible breadth of this world seeking new interests through which to stave off boredom. There are many other tales, all equally improbable, yet all equally possible.",
            "What is known about spirits is that in order to interact normally with the physical world, they need to wear containment suits, which can look like anything from heavy armor to simple robes. Without these, it is a major effort for them just to lift a pebble or turn a page. For some spirits, life without a containment suit is perfectly acceptable, as they loathe the mundane harshness of corporeal life. For others, wearing the suits serves only to remind them of the vast gulf that exists between them and other sentients on the Crucible."
         ],
         "why": [
            "While every spirit is unique unto itself, it is difficult for those outside their species to differentiate between individuals. Therefore, it is in the choices a spirit makes for their containment suit that hints of their personality tend to shine through. They might favor a suit of gleaming silver, enveloping vines and roots, networks of force-containment stones, or even ordinary clothing. If the idea of playing a character that is a manifestation of pure energy, possibly with a long-forgotten past or mysterious origin, appeals to you, then a spirit might be the one for you."

            "Sylicates are sentient beings of stone and minerals who lack organic flesh and carbon-based physiologies. Most of whom have a core of glowing energy; sometimes stone and minerals almost completely obscure the core, with only the being's shining eyes revealing their inner energy. Other sylicates have an exposed core with layers of rock flowing around it. Still others are quite solid, while a few are quasi-colloids made of sand and liquid that somehow hold their form. Almost all are vaguely humanoid, though smaller pebblings are shapeless shards who can bounce and even float about in the air until they achieve enough mass to form legs. As they age, many sylicates grow vibrant crystals along their body.",
            "Most sylicates are quite durable. This high level of resiliency still may not have been enough on their homeworld, a place sylicates refuse to speak of other than to mention eternal volcanic eruptions and unending acidic storms.",
            "Possibly as a result, sylicates seem to love the new world they are on. They are almost universally easygoing, with lifespans that are extraordinarily long. There are tales of sylicates who feel the need to rest for a while and so lie down for a few hundreds of years. Others, the truly ancient ones, sit and simply grow in size as they allow their accumulated wisdom and experience to seep into the ground below. Many mountains are believed to be such sylicates, and smaller hills the gestation places from which one day new sylicates will emerge."
         ],
         "why": [
            "While one might assume sylicates are as stoic as the stones they're composed of, the opposite is in fact true. Many are free-spirited and animated who love to explore the Crucible and its wildly varying terrain. Sylicates do not need to eat in the strictest sense, as they simply absorb the necessary nutrients from the ground beneath them. However, they adore the taste of rare silts and sands and are quite enamored with meals of braised volcanic glass and freshly squeezed diamonds. If the idea of playing a character who is as solid as a mountain—and looks quite a lot like one, too—appeals to you, then sylicates are your species."

Such conflicts could concern Æmber mining rights, access to prime grazing swamps, or which population will settle a newly transplanted environment that seems devoid of sentient life. Violence would likely be the outcome on almost any other world, but on the Crucible, there is always a desire for a solution that won't result in a glass desert or citysized crater. Simple violence just isn't efficient or conducive to long-lasting results, given the ever-changing nature of the Crucible and the extreme diversity of its beings (especially in regard to new arrivals). This is where Arbitrators come into play, acting as impartial negotiators and judges to help resolve disputes for the good of everyone.",

This is particularly likely in places where there is no law or when culprits have fled beyond the reach of local officials.",

            "Engineers love challenges, and the Crucible provides plenty. There are always buildings to erect, bridges to build, computers to program, and weapons to forge, all in different patterns and styles. The endless variety of technology on the world means that koolz-wood stoves can sit side by side with dimensional tensor furnaces, and each provides a new lesson in construction and repair. Though each species is unique, the principles of levers, fluid dynamics, and electron tunneling are constants—most of the time. Even when they aren't, Engineers can still make it all work through lots of joint lubrication, perseverance, and sweat. Often, lots and lots of sweat.",
            "Many groups greatly appreciate such effort, and Engineers are often employed in most cities for construction and repair as well as in universities and labs to refine technologies. Field Engineers serve in newly established settlements to create permanent infrastructure or fashion roads sturdy and reliable enough to establish trade across distant cities. They are also common sights in many excursions into ancient civilizations to study and possibly replicate any technologies unearthed there. Many engineers often aid newly arrived civilizations in translating their existing technologies to incorporate Æmber, something that is a necessity at some point.",

They might even be part of families where criminal skills are honed and passed down from generation to generation. A few have been known to join factions dedicated to uncovering riches beyond any mere burglary or contract killing, for there are treasures beyond belief in the Crucible for those willing to put aside morals or safety to pursue them. The truly successful Rogues, of course, eventually become legitimate—but there is always the temptation of just one more illicit job, one more thrill that demonstrates their independence from the rest of society.",
