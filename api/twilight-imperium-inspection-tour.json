The station's highly advanced gravitic sensors have picked up the signature from a superluminal drive as it decelerates to subluminal speeds only a few light years away. Clearly this is some sort of starship, and its course leads back to Mecatol Rex. However, no ships are expected and the station hasn't received any incoming messages.",
                        "The PCs happen to be much closer to the drive signature than the station, and Ssoro asks them to check out the drive signature and report back. The PCs track the drive signature to a dead star system containing a neutron star and the shattered husks of its former planets. Here, among the debris fields, they find a autonomous interstellar probe, roughly a quarter of the size of their ship. The technology is far too advanced to have been developed by any of the Great Civilizations, and the fact that it was coming from Mecatol Rex seems even more suspicious. So, the PCs bring the probe to Ccrysus Station.",

The probe is very tough and Captain Ssoro wants to proceed cautiously. However, they do manage to access the probe's internal databanks. Within they find files encrypted with a high level Galactic Council cypher. The PCs can't decrypt the cypher, but they can recognize its credentials and determine that this is something important.",

The probe was headed for system 57629BXR-79y67, another unremarkable star system even deeper in the galactic core. When Ssoro's long range gravitic detectors sweep the system, they start to pick up the deceleration of massive vessels from superluminal velocities down to subluminal speeds within the system.

Downloading the information without specific key codes awakens the virus fragments, which begin multiplying and then dominating the station's computers. Before the station's crew realize the threat, the Nekro Virus has already begun to take control of certain mechanical systems, including the auto-assemblers in the machine bays. With these, the Nekro begins churning out numerous murderous drones of various types. ",

At this point, the adventure splits off in several directions. The PCs can launch a last-ditch assault on the reactor core of the station in hopes of taking down the Nekro or blowing up the station (which they will not survive). They can attempt to preserve the data from the probe and the following scans by sequestering it in protected databases, in hopes that a rescue party might find it before the station was destroyed.

Officially, their purpose is to watch the approaches to Mecatol Rex from the direction of the galactic core. Most trade routes around Mecatol Rex pass near many inhabited star systems, making a sneak attack on the former Imperial capital nearly impossible. Near the core, however, the inhabited worlds thin out; the increased background radiation makes this region of space hostile to most forms of life. A determined battlefleet could take a detour through the core regions in order to launch a surprise attack on Mecatol Rex.",

Five years ago, the Mahact Gene-Sorcerers returned to the galaxy when they hurled their homeworld of Ixth from outside the galaxy into the galactic core. The Mahact ruled the galaxy nearly 30,000 years ago as a group of megalomaniacal and thoroughly evil tyrants. Upon their return, they made it clear they hadn't changed, and expected the various Great Civilizations to immediately submit to their renewed rule. ",
                        "Needless to say, that didn't happen, and so far the Mahact have acted cautiously. However, Mecatol Rex was one of their bastions before it was the Imperial capital, and they certainly recognize its symbolic value. The Winnarans (and the rest of the Galactic Council) fears at least one of the gene-sorcerers will soon launch an assault on the throneworld. They don't want to alarm the public, but the Mahact were the real impetus to build the monitoring stations.",

Individual ships can be tracked up to ten light years away, but the signals created by a large ships and fleets traveling at superluminal velocities can be detected at much further distances.",

So the Xxcha Kingdom set up their stations in a wide circular formation. In the center of the formation is a stealthed message buoy that is barely within communication distance of each station. The stations broadcast regular signals that can be picked up by the buoy. These signals are limited to \"all clear,\" \"request visit,\" and \"alert!\"",
